That’s exactly what you’ll learn how to do in this video. You’ll learn how to use Python to scrape finance news from the web, natural language processing via Hugging Face to automatically summarise that news and finally calculate sentiment related to each asset. The awesome thing is that you can do this for almost any financial asset as well. In the video we’ll run through the pipeline using Tesla, Bitcoin and Gamestop but you could plug in virtually any stock or crypto code and have this research done for you. In fact, at the end we’ll update the pipeline in two lines and run the same analysis for Ethereum as well. 

In this video, you'll learn how to:
1. Scrape stock and crypto news from the web using Python and BeautifulSoup

Keep getting beaten?

Want to absolutely smash everyone at Space Invaders?

Oh, have I got a solution for you! In this video you'll see the journey to building an AI model that's able to crush it at Space Invaders. We'll use, Reinforcement Learning, a similar technique to what was used by DeepMind in their documentary on AlphaGo. 

The model shown in the video was built using an ACER agent with OpenAI's stable_baselines package and Python. After around 40m steps the model performance tailed off a bit so the final model shown was one that seemed to consistently perform reasonably well.

Want to make the most of those sunny days when they come?

You're probably better off forecasting the weather yourself instead of relying. on the weather channel. 

The best thing is,  you can get started pretty easily using Neural Prophet. Neural Prophet is a relatively new library that uses Facebooks Prophet time series forecasting package and a Pytorch AR-Net model to produce highly accurate time series forecasts quickly. This makes it easy to build your own weather forecasts and forecast with any other time series style data. 

In this video you'll learn how to:
1. Preprocess a weather dataset from Kaggle using Pandas
2. Train a time series forecasting model to predict temperature using Neural Prophet
3. Forecast temperature into the future using the trained  model

Tired of manually transcribing?

You need OCR!

OCR, also known as Optical Character Recognition allows you to 'recognise' text from within a document, whether it be an image, a PDF or a table. Leveraging OCR, you can easily extract this text to be able to use it for additional processing, NLP, or fit it into your regular workflow. 

The great thing about EasyOCR (which is shown in the video) is that it works with Python and is quite accurate without any fine tuning, this means you can spend less time processing and more time doing the fun stuff. What's even better is that in this video you'll learn how to do it all in just 15 minutes. 

In this video you’ll learn how to:
1. Setup and install EasyOCR and Pytorch
2. Use EasyOCR to extract text from an Image with Python

Working out whether it’s a good or bad review is pretty easy right? 

You, read it, then you get a ‘feel’ for whether it’s good or bad. 

Well, now imagine you have 500 review, or 5,000 or even 5 million. 

Getting through all of these and working out which of them is REALLY bad or REALLY good is a whole lotta work. This is where sentiment analysis comes in. It allows you to leverage natural language processing to help speed up this process and work out whether something is good or bad. And because you’re able to do it using code…you can do it FAST. In this video you’ll get to do just that. You’ll learn how to apply sentiment analysis to the #PresidentialDebate Twitter feed in order to calculate overall sentiment (positive or negative) for each presidential candidate. 

In this video you’ll learn how to:
1. Setting up Twitter Dev
2. Querying #PresidentialDebate tweets from Twitter using Python
3. Using NLTK and TextBlob to calculate sentiment

When using TextBlob for sentiment analysis, you’re able to extract polarity and subjectivity. Polarity refers to how positive or negative something is with the range extending from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). Subjectivity refers to how much a piece of text is based on emotion with 0 being the least subjective and 1 being the most subjective. 
Sentiment Analysis can also (and is typically) used for:

* Customer feedback
* Financial markets analysis

Data preparation is often where you fix data types, perform scaling, create new features and prepare your data for modelling. 

In part two of the Python Machine Learning Regression series you'll learn how to:
- Cast columns to new data stypes using  df[col].astype()
- Identify and drop unneeded columns with df.drop()
- One-hot encode data using pd.get_dumimes()

Quick note from Lex: The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes in. Most folks still just listen to audio-only version, but here on YouTube, we did our best to still make it interesting to watch & listen by adding image overlays. I mess things up sometimes, like in this case, and it hits me hard when I do. But I'm always working hard to improve. I hope you understand. Thank you for your patience and support along the way. I love you all.

I love chess, always have, but chose to stop playing it myself early on when I became passionate about building AI systems, and instead became a fan of watching the game and the humans who play it.

- At 1 hour 27 minute mark, we overlay an image of Brian Greene. We meant to overlay an image of Michael Green, an early pioneer of string theory: https://bit.ly/michael-green-physicist

EDIT NOTE: I edited this episode quickly and made a couple of mistakes in how rough the cut looks. One weird cut is after the 2 hour mark, where it sounds like Bret is about to make a point, but I actually interrupt him for clarification and then go of on a tangent and never return. I edited out the interruption which made the cut look weird. I failed here both as an interviewer and editor. I'm trying to get better at both, and hire help for the latter, since I still do it all alone. Please be patient with me.

This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

Steven Pressfield is a historian and author of War of Art, a book that had a big impact on my life and the life of millions of whose passion is to create in art, science, business, sport, and everywhere else. I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic, including Turning Pro, Do the Work, Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and the Warrior Ethos. Also his books Gates of Fire about the Spartans and the battle at Thermopylae, The Lion's Gate, Tides of War, and others are some of the best historical fiction novels ever written.

624,xZlt2tqHd80,Lex Fridman,"20,000 Push-ups and Pull-ups in 30 Days Challenge (featuring David Goggins)","I tweeted: ""I will do as many push ups + pull ups next 30 days as this tweet gets likes, retweets & comments. No number is too high. Bring it."" It got 20,000, which is 4+ times more than what I was originally mentally prepared for. Still, I said I'll do it, so I will. This is likely the toughest physical and mental thing I've ever done.

In 30 days, I will do 20,000 push-ups + pull-ups, 35,000 bodyweight reps, and run 180 miles. 

For 30 days, every day I'm doing the following:
- 6 miles running
- 510 push-ups
- 170 pull-ups
- 170 ab rollers
- 340 squats

That's 34 rounds of:
- 15 push-ups
- 5 pull-ups
- 5 ab rollers
- 10 squats

Target time for 1 round above (including rest) is 2 minutes. This may not be feasible. We'll see.

I came across Dmitry's work when in February his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interactions with human proteins, in effect creating a structural genomics map of the coronavirus and making this data open and available to researchers everywhere. We talked about the biology of COVID-19, SARS, and viruses in general, and how computational methods can help us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.

Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist, and author of The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, The Magic of Reality, The Greatest Show on Earth, and his latest Outgrowing God. He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including funny enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution is an exceptionally powerful idea. He is outspoken, bold, and often fearless in his defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.

662,UfMyp1wFgxE,Lex Fridman,The Way Out | Lex Fridman (Original),"I wrote this song yesterday, thinking about the time we're in, about my grandfather in WWII, about the strength of community and the human spirit in tough times. Here are the lyrics:

the way out

my granddad was a soldier
on the fronts in 41
the bullets took his brothers
but his stubborn luck held on

the sky was filled with fire
millions lost in flames
hate and love were all there
and the world's never the same

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love

when the new york towers crumbled
we were all new yorkers too
for a moment all just human
not the same old red or blue

and the wicked'll go on scheming
for the power in the pain
but the heart that longs for freedom
is a fire they'll never tame

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love

the virus took our comfort
that was never  ours to own
when the enemy is inside us
we're together but alone

this life is so damn fragile
a leaf caught by the wind
but every breath that's tragic
ignites a hope within

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love","['original song', 'original guitar song', 'guitar', 'lex guitar']",2020-04-06T10:28:15Z,104307,5090,,441,PT3M40S,hd,true

He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff. So what you get is Hedgy.

John Hopfield is professor at Princeton, whose life's work weaved beautifully through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology through the piercing eyes of a physicist. He is perhaps best known for his work on associate neural networks, now known as Hopfield networks that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed the development of the modern field of deep learning.

Alex Garland, writer and director of many imaginative and philosophical films from the dreamlike exploration of human self-destruction in the movie Annihilation to the deep questions of consciousness and intelligence raised in the movie Ex Machina, which to me is one of the greatest movies on artificial intelligence ever made. I'm releasing this podcast to coincide with the release of his new series called Devs that will premiere this Thursday, March 5, on Hulu as part of ""FX on Hulu"". It explores many of the themes this very podcast is about: from quantum mechanics to artificial life to simulation to the modern nature of power in the tech world.

693,7jFdxd1qX2g,Lex Fridman,"Ann Druyan: Cosmos, Carl Sagan, Voyager, and the Beauty of Science | Lex Fridman Podcast #78","Ann Druyan is the writer, producer, director, and one of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time. She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9. It is hosted, once again, by the fun and brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.

John Hopfield is professor at Princeton, whose life's work weaved beautifully through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology through the piercing eyes of a physicist. He is perhaps best known for his work on associate neural networks, now known as Hopfield networks that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed the development of the modern field of deep learning.

Marcus Hutter is a senior research scientist at DeepMind and professor at Australian National University. Throughout his career of research, including with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, he has proposed a lot of interesting ideas in and around the field of artificial general intelligence, including the development of the AIXI model which is a mathematical approach to AGI that incorporates ideas of Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoff induction, and reinforcement learning.

I've been getting a lot of great questions on Patreon, so I'm trying a new thing (this video) where I answer one or a few questions on a particular topic in a 5-20 minute AMA. The aim is to do one a week. Let me know what you think. I apologize for the slow pace of talking. I'm learning how to communicate better without getting lost in my thoughts. My brain seems to work much faster than I speak, so I go down mental tangents which counter-intuitively slows the speaking. The brain is fascinating ;-)

Roll the Dice (Go All the Way)
Charles Bukowski

if you're going to try, go all the way.
otherwise, don't even start.

if you're going to try, go all the way.
this could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, jobs and
maybe your mind.

go all the way.
it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.
it could mean freezing on a
park bench.
it could mean jail,
it could mean derision,
mockery,
isolation.
isolation is the gift,
all the others are a test of your endurance,
of how much you really want to
do it.
and you'll do it
despite rejection and the worst odds
and it will be better than
anything else
you can imagine.

if you're going to try,
go all the way.
there is no other feeling like that.
you will be alone with the gods
and the nights will flame with fire.

do it, do it, do it.
do it.

all the way
all the way.

you will ride life straight to
perfect laughter, its
the only good fight
there is","['joe rogan', 'jre', 'bukowski', 'roll the dice']",2020-02-06T20:05:51Z,117658,5542,,191,PT1M27S,hd,false

Daniel Kahneman is winner of the Nobel Prize in economics for his integration of economic science with the psychology of human behavior, judgment and decision-making. He is the author of the popular book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" that summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ""System 1"" is fast, instinctive and emotional; ""System 2"" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking.

Donald Knuth is one of the greatest and most impactful computer scientists and mathematicians ever. He is the recipient in 1974 of the Turing Award, considered the Nobel Prize of computing. He is the author of the multi-volume work, the magnum opus, The Art of Computer Programming. He made several key contributions to the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms. He popularized asymptotic notation, that we all affectionately know as the big-O notation. He also created the TeX typesetting which most computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and scientists and engineers use to write technical papers and make them look beautiful.

745,ZVbAOpYv7Sk,Lex Fridman,If by Rudyard Kipling (read by Lex Fridman),"This is a poem by Rudyard Kipling titled If. It is a father giving advice to his son.

If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a man, my son.

Writing music and poetry have been a part of my life for many years, along with science and martial arts. I've written a lot of songs, almost all of which no one has ever heard, including close friends. Me playing covers and reading this poem is a step toward it. My main passion is artificial intelligence (especially engineering of it into real-world systems) but guitar, piano, wrestling, jiu jitsu, and judo have helped me in that pursuit in fundamental ways that I hope to elucidate over time. If this is not your thing, please be patient and ignore it. But if you enjoy it, your support and love are always appreciated.

750,CWb2DGmyr74,Lex Fridman,Nirvana by Charles Bukowski (read by Lex Fridman),"This is a poem by Charles Bukowski titled Nirvana: 

Not much chance completely cut loose from purpose
He was a young man riding a bus
Through North Carolina on the way to somewhere
And it began to snow

And the bus stopped at a little café in the hills
And the passengers entered
And he sat at the counter with the others
And he ordered the food arrived
And the meal was particularly good
And the coffee

The waitress was unlike the women he had known
She was unaffected and there was a natural humor which came from her
And the fry cook said crazy things
And the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh

And the young man watched the snow through the window
And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever
The curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there
And it would always stay beautiful there

And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board
And the young man thought I'll just stay here
I'll just stay here
And then he rose and he followed the others into the bus
He found his seat and looked at the café through the window
And then the bus moved off down a curve downward out of the hills

And the young man looked straight forward
And he heard the other passengers speaking of other things
Or they were reading or trying to sleep
And they hadn't noticed the magic
And the young man put his head to one side
Closed his eyes and pretended to sleep

There was nothing else to do
Just to listen to the sound of the engine
And the sound of the tires
In the snow

I've written a lot of songs, almost all of which no one has ever heard, including close friends. Me playing covers and reading this poem is a step toward it. My main passion is artificial intelligence (especially engineering of it into real-world systems) but guitar, piano, wrestling, jiu jitsu, and judo have helped me in that pursuit in fundamental ways that I hope to elucidate over time. If this is not your thing, please be patient and ignore it. But if you enjoy it, your support and love are always appreciated.

Sebastian Thrun is one of the greatest roboticists, computer scientists, and educators of our time. He led development of the autonomous vehicles at Stanford that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and placed second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. He then led the Google self-driving car program which launched the self-driving revolution. He taught the popular Stanford course on Artificial Intelligence in 2011 which was one of the first MOOCs. That experience led him to co-found Udacity, an online education platform. He is also the CEO of Kitty Hawk, a company working on building flying cars or more technically eVTOLS which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.

Judea Pearl is a professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He is one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian Networks and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just for AI, but to our understanding and practice of science. But in the field of AI, the idea of causality, cause and effect, to many, lies at the core of what is currently missing and what must be developed in order to build truly intelligent systems. For this reason, and many others, his work is worth returning to often.

Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Whitney Cummings is a stand-up comedian, actor, producer, writer, director, and the host of a new podcast called Good for You. Her most recent Netflix special called ""Can I Touch It?"" features in part a robot, she affectionately named Bearclaw, that is designed to be visually a replica of Whitney. It's exciting for me to see one of my favorite comedians explore the social aspects of robotics and AI in our society. She also has some fascinating ideas about human behavior, psychology, and neurology, some of which she explores in her book called ""I'm Fine...And Other Lies.""

Dava Newman is the Apollo Program professor of AeroAstro at MIT and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA and has been a principal investigator on four spaceflight missions. Her research interests are in aerospace biomedical engineering, investigating human performance in varying gravity environments. She has developed a space activity suit, namely the BioSuit, which would provide pressure through compression directly on the skin via the suit's textile weave, patterning, and materials rather than with pressurized gas.

Dava Newman is the Apollo Program professor of AeroAstro at MIT and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA and has been a principal investigator on four spaceflight missions. Her research interests are in aerospace biomedical engineering, investigating human performance in varying gravity environments. She has developed a space activity suit, namely the BioSuit, which would provide pressure through compression directly on the skin via the suit's textile weave, patterning, and materials rather than with pressurized gas.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion.

Michael Kearns is a professor at University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new book Ethical Algorithm that is the focus of much of our conversation, including algorithmic fairness, bias, privacy, and ethics in general. But, that is just one of many fields that Michael is a world-class researcher in, some of which we touch on quickly including learning theory or theoretical foundations of machine learning, game theory, algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, computational social science, and more.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, futurist, and professor at the City College of New York. He is the author of many fascinating books on the nature of our reality and the future of our civilization.

Garry Kasparov is considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time. From 1986 until his retirement in 2005, he dominated the chess world, ranking world number 1 for most of those 19 years. While he has many historic matches against human chess players, in the long arc of history he may be remembered for his match again a machine, IBM's Deep Blue. His initial victories and eventual loss to Deep Blue captivated the imagination of the world of what role Artificial Intelligence systems may play in our civilization's future. That excitement inspired an entire generation of AI researchers, including myself, to get into the field. Garry is also a pro-democracy political thinker and leader, a fearless human-rights activist, and author of several books including How Life Imitates Chess which is a book on strategy and decision-making, Winter Is Coming which is a book articulating his opposition to the Putin regime, and Deep Thinking which is a book the role of both artificial intelligence and human intelligence in defining our future.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, futurist, and professor at the City College of New York. He is the author of many fascinating books on the nature of our reality and the future of our civilization.

It serves as an interface to several deep learning libraries, most popular of which is TensorFlow, and it was integrated into TensorFlow main codebase a while back. Aside from creating an exceptionally useful and popular library, François is also a world-class AI researcher and software engineer at Google, and is definitely an outspoken, if not controversial, personality in the AI world, especially in the realm of ideas around the future of artificial intelligence.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

François Chollet is the creator of Keras, which is an open source deep learning library that is designed to enable fast, user-friendly experimentation with deep neural networks. It serves as an interface to several deep learning libraries, most popular of which is TensorFlow, and it was integrated into TensorFlow main codebase a while back. Aside from creating an exceptionally useful and popular library, François is also a world-class AI researcher and software engineer at Google, and is definitely an outspoken, if not controversial, personality in the AI world, especially in the realm of ideas around the future of artificial intelligence.

Colin Angle is the CEO and co-founder of iRobot, a robotics company that for 29 years has been creating robots that operate successfully in the real world, not as a demo or on a scale of dozens, but on a scale of thousands and millions. As of this year, iRobot has sold more than 25 million robots to consumers, including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot, the Braava floor mopping robot, and soon the Terra lawn mowing robot. 25 million robots successfully operating autonomously in people's homes to me is an incredible accomplishment of science, engineering, logistics, and all kinds of entrepreneurial innovation.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech, specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He is the author of several popular books: one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called The Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on Quantum Mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, Ethics, Politics, Academia, and much much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he is the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

He is the author of several popular books: one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called The Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on Quantum Mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, Ethics, Politics, Academia, and much much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he is the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

Let me know if you have song requests for next year, and maybe before. Maybe one day I'll play an original song as well.

This song was recorded with Ableton Live. It has 3 guitar tracks. The video shows me playing one of the tracks. Next time, instead of layering, I'll just do it with a single track and a loop pedal like I would if I was playing it live. I'm new to recording music. The goal is to always be improving and enjoying the process, in all things, which I do.

Writing and playing music has been a creative refuge for me throughout my life, providing balance and breadth to the focused rigors of research.

986,Zsbb1Ze4T_M,Lex Fridman,Peter Norvig: Utility in AI,"""One of our challenges for the future is to describe to our markets and to our high-tech products what is it that we really want. In AI, there's a common goal of maximizing expected utility. We've spent decades on the 'expected' and the 'maximizing' parts, but have taken the 'utility' as a given. Until the public has the power to say what it is it really wants, the markets will choose poorly."" - Peter Norvig, Director of Research, Google (2016)

1032,wiYMwmPPGto,Lex Fridman,Detecting Driver Frustration from Audio and Video (IJCAI 2016),"More information: http://lexfridman.com/driverfrustration
Paper PDF: http://ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/195.pdf

We present a method for detecting driver frustration from both video and audio streams captured during the driver's interaction with an in-vehicle voice-based navigation system. The video is of the driver's face when the machine is speaking, and the audio is of the driver's voice when he or she is speaking. We analyze a dataset of 20 drivers that contains 596 audio epochs (audio clips, with duration from 1 sec to 15 sec) and 615 video epochs (video clips, with duration from 1 sec to 45 sec). The dataset is balanced across 2 age groups, 2 vehicle systems, and both genders. The model was subject-independently trained and tested using 4-fold cross-validation. We achieve an accuracy of 77.4% for detecting frustration from a single audio epoch and 81.2% for detecting frustration from a single video epoch. We then treat the video and audio epochs as a sequence of interactions and use decision fusion to characterize the trade-off between decision time and classification accuracy, which improved the prediction accuracy to 88.5% after 9 epochs.

THIS EPISODE ► Ever since he was a young child, Niko has loved Explosions. REAL Explosions. But as practical pyrotechnics fall out of favor in Hollywood, CG Booms are becoming prevalent and he's become disenchanted. Hopefully Jordan Allen can convince him that all hope is not lost, and there is a way for CG explosions to achieve cinematic greatness.

A big thanks to Urban Bradesko and Matt Puchala for their help with this video! The explosion in the video that was originally credited to Urban Bradesko was actually created by Matt Puchala. They are working together and we mixed them up. Our apologizes to both of them!

If you want to get some way more in-depth conversation about these tools and how we’re using AI, Check out the Corridor podcast. Http://youtube.com/corridorcast

THIS EPISODE ► As Ai image generation takes the art world by storm, Niko sits down to see if he can harness its power and create the first-ever narrative story illustrated entirely by a computer.

A message from Niko ► Hi there! If you’re reading this far, it’s probably because you want to learn more about this technology, and possibly want to run it yourself.

The easiest and simplest way to try Stable Diffusion is through their official online tool, Dream Studio - https://beta.dreamstudio.ai

Now, if you want to get in on the open source movement, you can have this up and running on most modern PCs for free. However, if you’ve never worked with open source projects before, there is a learning curve to get started. Don’t worry! With a little focused time you’ll be up and running, and there are many of us online ready to help.

The two communities I recommend starting with:
Official Stable Diffusion Discord - https://discord.gg/stablediffusion
r/StableDiffusion - http://reddit.com/r/stablediffusion

You got questions? Start there!

At the studio we’re currently running AUTOMATIC1111’s version of Stable Diffusion. If you want to install it, here’s a guide: https://stablediffusionguides.carrd.co/#one

Check out the other guides on that site as well, for other ways to run Stable Diff. You can even run it on the could!

As for Dreambooth… you’re gonna need access to some serious hardware to run it. In time I’m sure this will change, but at this moment it is very challenging. Be forewarned!

Here is the official project from Google: https://dreambooth.github.io

And this is the implementation in Stable Diffusion I recommend you try: https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion

I’ll be honest with you- I am no ML scientist, and I can’t break down in detail how the code works. This is raw experimental stuff, and frankly most of us have no idea what we’re doing. But we’re chipping away at it! I recommend stopping by this specific discord thread if you wanna help out: https://discord.gg/thwu44bc

And finally, all of this is possible right now because of open sharing of knowledge and collaboration. Keep this spirit alive and share! You’re one of the pioneers- let’s learn from and support each other!

Wren dives deep into exploring the sense of scale in the anime Attack on Titan. The Corridor Crew put a lot of effort and long hours into making this one, as you can tell by the large amount of VFX.

Shoutout to two artists who helped make it happen!!
Lucas Knepper provided the Armored Titan and you can find him on twitter at https://twitter.com/LucasTom21
ChunkkaDraws provided us with a Colossal Titan! He made more too but we unfortunately couldn't fit them in the video. https://twitter.com/SketchDasher

You don't always need a Red camera, in fact, we shot this only on the Red and the iphone 6+, some shots on each look great, some don't.  That's because it doesn't matter which camera you use, it matters on how you use them.

""Which camera looks like it made better images?""

(BONUS INFO)
And finally, as a gift to all you filmmakers out there.  We tried to put together a ""Beginner's Cheat Sheet"" to what levels you can aim for when mixing your video, movie, or show.  

This is a guideline to start from.

2140,kzwT3wQWAHE,Sebastian Lague,Complex Behaviour from Simple Rules: 3 Simulations,"A small display of some of the surprisingly intricate patterns and behaviours that can arise from relatively simple rules. More information about each of the simulations below.

These simulations were made in Unity, and coded with C# and HLSL.
You can find the project files at the links below.
Reaction-Diffusion: https://github.com/SebLague/Reaction-Diffusion
Cellular Automata: https://github.com/SebLague/MN-Cellular-Automata
Slime mould: https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation

If you'd like to support my work, you can do so on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SebastianLague

---- 1. Reaction-Diffusion ----
This is a simulation of two chemicals (A and B). Both diffuse over time (A faster than B).
The simulation space is initially filled with A, and just a small region has some of chemical B. Over time, more A is gradually added (controlled by a parameter called feedRate), while B is gradually removed (controlled by the parameter removeRate). Finally, there's a reaction that takes place: when one particle of chemical A is in the presence of two particles of chemical B, it will be converted into B.

One could simulate the individual particles of both chemicals, but more common (and the approach I went with as well) is to just store a value for the concentrations of both chemicals at each pixel. The probability of an A particle coming into contact with two B particles can be determined by the equation: probablityOfReaction = concentrationA * concentrationB * concentrationB. Here is the tutorial I followed when creating my implementation: https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html

The colours in the simulation are mainly based on the concentrations of the two chemicals, but to spice things up I also added some colouring based on how fast the concentrations are changing at each point.


---- 2. Multiple Neighbourhood Cellular Automata ----
This is a technique developed by someone who goes by Slackermanz online (you can find many awesome examples under that name on Twitter).

In this simulation, the state of each pixel (called a cell) is initially randomized between 0 and 1. On every frame, the state of each cell is updated based on the states of all the cells inside various ""neighbourhoods"" around it. These neighboughhoods are ring-shaped, with each ring defined by a min and max radius, along with two min/max values called 'alive' and 'dead'. Once all the states inside a ring have been added up, the sum is compared to the ring's alive and dead ranges, and depending on which range the sum falls into, the cell's state increases or decreases by some small amount (if the sum is inside neither range, the state remains the same).

This already gives interesting results, but there are some more nuances that can be added. For example, instead of the rings directly affecting the cell's state, they can contribute to several 'potential' states, and whichever of these is most different from the cell's current state becomes the new state.

My implementation is based on Slackermanz code, which you can find here: https://github.com/Slackermanz/VulkanAutomata
Slackermanz also has a YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoNsNuM0M9VsIXfm2cHPiA


---- 3. Slime Mould Simulation ----
In this simulation we have a lot lot of particles, each of which leaves a trail behind itself as it moves. These trails diffuse and evaporate over time. Each particle also has three circular sensors arranged in an arc in front it. These are used to detect the intensity of the trail, and the particle turns towards whichever detects the highest intensity. Some randomness is added to the turning as well.

The idea for this comes from this paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579
I also have a video exploring it in some more depth: https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A

Some notes:
• I made a little build where you can play with the atmosphere settings yourself, which you can find over here if you're interested: https://sebastian.itch.io/atmosphere-experiment

• A number of knowledgeable people have pointed out in the comments that reality is not nearly as simple as my little diagram around the 4 and a half minute mark, and that light does not literally wiggle up and down like a wave, so please note that the diagram is incorrect!

• This project was inspired by the game Outer Wilds, which I highly recommend playing!

Note:
Two issues have been pointed out which I'd like to address: (will add these fixes at end of next video)
1) changing resolution causes uv out of bounds error. This can be fixed by checking mesh.uv.Length == uv.Length before assigning the uvs in ConstructMesh method.
2) biome colours appearing in wrong places when zoomed out (on certain devices). To fix this, mipmaps need to be disabled on the planet texture. In the ColourGenerator, replace with:
texture = new Texture2D(textureResolution, settings.biomeColourSettings.biomes.Length, TextureFormat.RGBA32, false);﻿

2225,D3gbXAVcG-0,Sebastian Lague,[Unity] Camera Shake,"In this video we create a simple camera shake system, with several parameters to control the appearance of the shake.

NOTE: There've been some criticisms about the shake looking a bit ""off"", mostly due to the camera not slowing down towards the end. I have added an update to the source code to try and address this. The change is simple: the ""speed"" variable has been replaced with a maxSpeed and a minSpeed variable. The current speed of the shake is then determined by interpolating between these two values based on the damping curve. This change does make the ""duration"" variable less precise, but hopefully that isn't too great a concern.

UPDATE:
At ~15:16 in the video, the lines copied should preferably be pasted BEFORE the call to OnObjectReuse(), so that when that method is called, the object will already have its correct position/rotation values. This could be important when resetting certain things, for example the velocity of a projectile based on its initial rotation.

FAQ:
Q: QueryTriggerInteraction does not exist in the current context?
A: Upgrade to Unity 5.2+, or leave that parameter out and turn on raycast triggers in the physics settings (edit - project settings)

Q: Why use raycasts instead of OnTriggerEnter to detect projectile collisions?
A: At very high projectile speeds OnTriggerEnter might not be called (since the projectile would be in front of enemy one frame, and through it the next). Raycasting just makes sure that collisions will work no matter the projectile speed.

FAQ:
Q: Leg doesn't bend once I add pole target to leg IK:
A: This will happen if your upper and lower leg bones are completely straight. To fix, go into edit mode on the rig and select just the 'knee joint' where the upper and lower leg bones meet. Move it forward a tiny bit toward the character's feet to give the leg a slight natural bend. This will help the IK figure out how you want it to behave.

FAQ:
Q: My background images won't show up after dragging them in.
A: Ensure that your view is properly aligned (press 1 on numpad to set view from front). You also need to be in orthographic (as opposed to perspective) view. You can toggle between ortho and perspective with 5 on the numpad. If, for whatever reason, simply dragging the images in does not work for you, you can also add them manually by pressing 'n' to open the properties panel, navigating to the 'Background Images' section near the bottom, and pressing ""Add Image"".

Q: Pressing the numbers only changes frame/layer.
A: You need to press the numbers on the numpad (as opposed to the top row of numbers). If your keyboard does not have a numpad, go into preferences and in the input tab check 'emulate numpad'.

Read FAQ below:

Follow me on Twitter @SebastianLague
Download starting file: http://bit.ly/rigTutStart
Watch my animation tutorial using this rig: http://bit.ly/walkCycleTut

FAQ:
Q: Shift+Ctrl+C is not bringing up the add constraints menu.
A: This will only work if you're in POSE mode.

Q: Leg/arm is not bending (or is bending in the wrong direction) when I move the ik bone.
A: In edit mode select the joint (where the upper and lower leg/arm meet) and move it slightly so that it has an initial bend in the direction you want.

Q: If I move the ik bone down to far the leg starts stretching at the foot.
A: Parent the foot to the lower leg bone instead of the ik bone. To make the foot still follow the rotation of the ik bone, select foot bone in pose mode and turn of inherit rotation in bone properties. Then select the ik bone, shift select the foot bone and press shift+ctrl+c and add a copy rotation constraint. In the constraints tab set both of the 'Space' fields to Local Space.

Q: Arm or leg moves unpredictably/wildly with even the slightest movement of ik bone.
A: IK is most probably still parented to the lower leg/arm bone. In edit mode, select the ik bone and press alt+p to clear the parenting.

Q: What is the period key?
A: The full stop you (should) put at the end of a sentence.

Q: How do you flip the bones after duplicating with shift+d?
A: Press 's' to scale, 'x' to constrain to x axis, and '-1' to flip. Left click to confirm.

Q: Whole rig moves wildly and unpredictable in pose mode.
A: The chain length on one of the ik bones is 0.

5:40 مدينة أحمد زويل ورؤية احمد زويل والطموح لتنمية الفكر النقدي ضد ""الخرافة"" في المجتمع. امتحان الولوج المعتمد على الفهم بدل الحفظ واختلاف نتائجه عن نتائج امتحان الثانوي لنفس الطلبة
43:57 فيزياء الجاذبية
16:29العلوم الزائفة ولائحة معتز امام للتخاريف في الانترنت وبعض الادوات للتعرف سريعا على تخاريف العلوم الزائفة
24:30 أبحاث طارق ابراهيم وعجائب نظرية الكوانتوم والحقل الكمومي
45:50 ""انا سعيد انني تولدت بعد اينشتاين"" والجمال الشاعري ""الصوفي"" لابحاث اينشتاين
35:19 ""أبونا رتشرد فاينمان"" وكلامه الحكيم ذو النكهة ""الروحية""
47:50 معتز إمام ونبذة عن النسبية الخاصة والعامة

57:39 التجارب الذهنية لاينشتاين مثل تجربة السقوط في المصعد وابحاث اينشتاين الرائعة والفريدة في تاريخ العلم
54:12 انحناء الزمكان ليس بالضرورة في أبعاد اضافية
1:06:00 تنبؤ اينشتاين بموجات الجاذبية وتنبؤ هرتز بالموجات الكهرمغناطيسية
1:05:00 التزويج بين ميكانيك الكم والجاذبية وحالة الألم الحالية في الفيزياء النظرية بعد القفزات النوعية في فيزياء القرن الماضي
1:09:50 الثقوب الدودية وهل دخولك الى ثقب اسود سيجعلك تسافر إلى مكان اخر في الكون والتواضع العلمي في غياب الاثباتات التجريبية
1:07:29 التفردات والاماكن التي تتقاطع فيها ميكانيك الكم مع الجاذبية
1:11:30 ثورة العلم هي ثورة فكرية انسانية عميقة 

كنت مؤخرا في زيارة لمصر والتقيت صديقين هناك الدكتور طارق ابراهيم والدكتور معتز إمام.. فيزيائيان يعشقان العلم قررا الاسهام في بلدهما مصر بعد مسيرة من البحث العلمي في أمريكا.
1:14:40 توصيات وأفكار في موضوع التعليم
1:23:14 تخاريف الاعجاز العلمي وزغلول النجار وضرورة تقدمنا جميعا إلى الأمام في الحوار الفكري

طارق هو العميد الأكاديمي لمعهد مدينة أحمد زويل للعلوم والتكنولوجيا التي أسسها أحمد زويل نوبل العلوم الوحيد في التاريخ من منطقة شمال افريقيا والشرق الاوسط، طارق له أبحاث عديدة مرموقة في فيزياء الحقل الكمومي. معتز استاذ مساعد في المعهد وفي جامعة نيو يورك وباحث في فيزياء الجاذبية.

شغّلنا الكاميرا وكان الحوار شيقا لدرجة أنه لم ننتبه حتى مرت ساعة ونصف. تحدثنا عن مدينة احمد زويل.. عن الفهم مقابل الحفظ في تدريس العلوم.. عن ماهية العلم وكيفية اشتغال العلم.. عن نظرية النسبية ونظرية الحقل الكمومي والثقوب السوداء.. وكذلك عن العلوم الزائفة وانتشارها في شبكات التواصل..

أتمنى أن تستمعو بالحوار كما استمتعنا به نحن. ❤️

الفهم الأعمق ديال الثقوب السوداء ميمكن يكون الا اذا قريتي على نظرية النسبية.
باش تقرا النسبية غادي تحتاج ل:
ـ الميكانيك الكلاسيكية خاصة الميكانيك ديال نيوتن. يعني تكون ضابط مزيان المقرر دالفيزيك ديال الليسي.
- L'algèbre linéaire / espaces vectoriels, l'analyse

اذا كان عندك هاد جوج دالحاجات يمكنلك ديك الساع تتعلم النسبية.. اذا كنتي باغي غير امور عامة وما باغيش تولي خبير ولكن باغي تفهم عموما الموضوع تقدر تشوف فيديوات اللي كتشرح النسبية بشكل ديال ""تبسيط العلوم"" ولكن كتبدا من الصفر وكتعطي المفاهيم الاساسية ديال النظرية دون الدخول فالتفاصيل. هاد الفيديوات هي نوعا ما ""دروس تقديمية للموضوع"". انصح بالفيديوات بالفرنسية ديال بروس بنعمران صاحب قناة

2451,SlkVfRWuHcY,Najib El Mokhtari,علاش الصين لا تأتي ـ2- تجربة الديكابوتابل,"هاد الفيديو كيوضح علاش إلى طلعات طائرة للسما وحبست ماغاديش تهرب عليها الأرض بفعل الدوران ديالها. السبب هو القصور وليس وجود الطائرة داخل الغلاف الجوي. الفيديو فيه كذلك تجربة ديال أنك ترمي حجرة للفوق من طوموبيل ديكابوتابل. حسب غاليليو (ونيوتن من بعدو) الحجرة خسا تحافظ على نفس السرعة الأفقية بفعل القصور (إذا أهملنا التأثير ديال الهوا). المبدأ ديال القصور غادي يبني عليه نيوتن ""القانون الأول للحركة"" وهو أحد القوانين اللي اعطت الانطلاقة لعلم الميكانيكا الحديث.

هاد الفيديو تم إنجازه بمساعدة:
ـ أيمن شهبوني (المساعدة في مونتاج الفيديو)
ـ مجيد العايسي وأنيسة علوبان (تصوير تجربة الديكابواتبل)
ـ السي احمد (مول الديكابوتابل)

واحد الملاحظة بالخفّ.. فالفيديو قلنا أنه إذا خدينا شي مكعب ديال الهواء من مستوى سطح البحر.. ومن بعد طلعنا ل 8 كم وخدينا مكعب آخر من نفس الحجم.. غادي نلقاو الكتلة ديال المكعب الثاني أقل. هاد النقصان هو بالفعل ديال الكتلة بحال اللي فالفيديو (وماشي ديال الوزن).. وهو راجع لكون الكثافة ديال الهواء (يعني الكتلة ديال متر مكعب من الهواء) كا تنقص كلما طلعنا لفوق. الوزن (اللي هو القوة اللي كا تجبد بيها الأرض المكعب ديال الهواء) كا ينقص حتا هو ولكن ماشي هادي النقطة هنا. النقطة هي أن الكثافة ديال الهوا كا تنقص بشويا بشويا وما كاين حتا شي فاصل مادي كيفصل بين داخل الغلاف الجوي وخارجه. الهدف من هاد الفكرة هو تصحيح ديال مغالطة ديال أن كاين سقف كيحدّ الغلاف الجوي وأي حاجة داخل داك السقف كا تدور مع الارض وأي حاجة خارج السقف ما كا تدورش مع الارض. هاد الفكرة غير صحيحة. الطائرة ديال مراكش كا تبقا غادا بسرعة 1420 كم فالساعة بفعل القصور وليس لأنها ""داخل سقف مادي يجر ما داخله معه"".

Veritasium video on FFTs
https://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo

A small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.

Another small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning ""the number of operations needed scales with N^2"". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor

Timetable:
0:00 - What is the paradox?
5:53 - The Bayes factor
11:00 - The snazzy Bayes rule
14:42 - Contrast with the usual formula

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Mistakes:
In the off-handed remarks on quaternions, I mentioned rotation in 4d would require 10 degrees of freedom.  That's wrong, what I should have said was it requires 6 degrees of freedom, and rotation in 5D is what requires 10 degrees of freedom.

Not on the ""homework"" to show that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y). This gets a little more intricate if you start asking seriously about whether the series really converge, what they converge to, and how exactly you define a product with infinitely many terms. For anyone curious about the technical details, what you would want to show is that the Cauchy Product of the series for exp(x) and exp(y) converges to the product of the values exp(x) and exp(y) for any particular x and y. That requires the Merten's Theorem.

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina

Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.

While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I

7:20 - Why the galactic spirals
9:30 - Euler’s totient function
10:28 - The larger scale
14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Another perspective from this channel:

And yet another from the blog Better Explained:
https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

- Fourier drawing: 300
- Nail and Gear: 200
- Treble clef: 100

And to continue my unabashed Strogatz fanboyism, I should also mention that his textbook on nonlinear dynamics and chaos was also a meaningful motivator to do this series, as you'll hopefully see with the topics we build to.

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):

You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

Thanks to Dan Walsh for many great ideas, and thanks to Mike Hansen for many helpful conversations.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.

And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decrease for lower length scales.

Writing and animations by Sridhar Ramesh, with editing and narration by Grant Sanderson.

Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

More on Doppler radar:
Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808

There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  

This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.

This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.

I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!

*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.

What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.

Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.

Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Regarding the brief reference to Fermat's Last Theorem, what should be emphasized is that it refers to *positive* integers.  You can of course have things like 0^3 + 2^3 = 2^3, or (-3)^3 + 3^3 = 0^3.

Note, to illustrate my point for the target audience of a new calculus student, I discussed a hypothetical speedometer that makes distance measurements over a very small time.  Interestingly, most actual speedometers in modern cars work by analyzing the induced current of a spinning magnet, which is in some sense the universe implementing the derivative.

There's a slight mistake at 13:33, where the angle should be arctan(1/2) = 26.565 degrees, not 30 degrees.  Arg!  If anyone asks, I was just...er...rounding to the nearest 10's.

One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).

The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose ""Hausdorff dimension"" is greater than its ""topological dimension"".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  

Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.

See Mandelbrot's book ""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" for the full details and more examples.

Also, in a different video ""What does it feel like to invent math"", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers: https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, ~0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

For anyone who wants to understand the cross-product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.

Minor error at 1:44, the third line of the matrix should read ""v1 * w2 - w1 * v2""

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

Dot products are a nice geometric tool for understanding projection.  But now that we know about linear transformations, we can get a deeper feel for what's going on with the dot product, and the connection between its numerical computation and its geometric interpretation.

Error corrections: 
- At one point I mistakenly allude to calculators using the Taylor expansion of sine for its computations, when in reality most use CORDIC (or something like it).
- Around 30 seconds in, there is a typo in how the determinant is written, which should be ad - bc
