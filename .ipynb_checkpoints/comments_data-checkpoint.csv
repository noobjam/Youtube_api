The ""trained helplessness"" highlighted my thoughts and noticed that my ""ego"" usually makes me unconsciously push things to the limit and eventually self-sabotaging patterns remain unfixed.\xa0\nBefore i go way off topic, let me compassionately write what I had written without a ""victim mentality"" which for some reason I subconsciously despise that attitude and after not being to jog daily as I used to, I fell into that category myself. I was stabbed at a jogging trail and the way I look at the world is just totally different. But anyways back to what I was going to say which I find it truly valuable, yet ""If I know what works"" why don\'t i stick to it daily?\xa0\nOne morning in Houston, Tx my ""mental guides"" perhaps told me to carry a penny in my palm for the entire day. It\'s not the first time I get these mental downloads\xa0so I said ok to the challenge.\xa0\nI had to write down in my journal the times I dropped it or lose it and when I did, as soon as I got conscious of it I would try my best to get another one or just carried a pebble or any item simple enough to carry. So the times I dropped it or lose it (what were my thoughts at that time/ what caused it and so on) I wrote all that down.\xa0\nSurprisingly, I became more self aware and noticed many synchronicities on my first day. The trick is to try to lovingly carry that penny with commitment and devotion. You then notice how the ""hand,"" ""heart"" and ""head"" can become like a family dedicating their mission to stick together, hence more alignment.\xa0\nI was impressed during the day because it felt like my mental paradigm had shifted and I found more purpose in the things I had to do. In the evening a teen fell off from her motor scooter in the middle of a street and I was only about 5 feet away and gave her a hand to get up. She was stunned as she was looking at a ""hero"" or a ""space alien,"" something to that effect. She was white and well I\'m just a hip hispanic and well perhaps she noticed that I was as stunt as her.\xa0All these events happened around Discovery Green in Houston by Toyota Center.\xa0\nOn another night I had a lot of good food and corn bread\xa0and didn\'t want to get rid of it so I left it in a bench by outside basketball courts.\xa0\nThe following night I see an old lady having trouble with her luggage crossing the street so I decided to help carry it around for her. She told she was looking for the place she stays at to sleep so I kept walking with her and she couldn\'t find it and I was getting tired and had a lot of black folk looking at me strangely, but I only had good intentions and so once I knew it was going to take a while to find it I decided to talk about my week and told her I had left some food at a bench and I hoped somebody got it and she was ""Ohh so it was you who left it?"" she wasn\'t even as surprised as I was, she said that was sweet. Besides being surprised I was also pissed because we had walked so much and we were heading totally the opposite direction of when she needed to get ha. So once we arrived there, I thought wow, I left the good food at her home, which she considered that place her place where she stays.\xa0\nAfter that so many things happened that I couldn\'t travel back to my city in Laredo, Tx so I would keep popping up and visiting her, and she kept telling me, I knew you were going to continue to come around and so on.\xa0\nAnyways, you might get impressed by how ""useful"" we can be. We\'ll continuously ask ourselves what are we doing with our hands? Are they to give, give, give? Am I receiving anything with my hands? If one hand can create and do a lot, imagine our 2 hands. Is my head all there, Is my heart running the show or who is? Once you notice you become very clumsy and impulsive, you\'ll learn that it\'s that inner child running the show, so imagine that? ha It can be good or bad, and sometimes it seems good, but with negative consequences at the end.\xa0\nMind/logic/King\nHeart/compassion/Queen\nInner Child, Divine Child,\xa0High chair tyrant, infantile grandiosity... catch negative patterns and investigate who\'s running the show.\xa0\nA helping hand can go a long way. When we are aligned with our Self we get to experience order and pleasant vibes and when we are not, well it\'s like a chaotic family in one room, imagine that.\xa0\nTouch your heart with one hand and your head with the other. Tell yourself, Lets Help Each Other.\xa0\nTry not to drop the penny tho ha\nIf you need to put it down, do so, but remember it\'s key to make a note every time you dropped it or lose it. It works if you work it.

So he is arguing that the presence of a lot of unorganized transistors can intelligently organize themselves to create information (logic) and thus form intelligence.

Therefore, it is actually a moot-point in terms of meaning of life, as regardless of whatever other living parts or living degrees of cognition there are, the one this agent is, is the one this agent is.""]"

NATO than began to entrench themselves in Ukraine with the US 7th Training Division, Air Combat Training units, British Intelligence, US bio weapons labs etc. Along side this, the sons of the US ruling elites such as Biden‚Äôs, Romney‚Äôs, Pelosi‚Äôs and Kerry‚Äôs sons tied up with Ukrainian Nazi Oligrachs to plunder Ukrainian resources.\nBiden called Putin a liar in his first public interview after stealing the White House and refused Russia the ‚ÄúNo Aggression‚Äù pact to force Putin who had been kicking the can down the road since 2002 to retake Eastern Ukraine to protect ethnic Russians from US sponsored genocide. The US and NATO blessed the Minsk Agreements to buy time from Russia to weaponize Ukraine while continuing the genocide without regard for the Germany and France brokered Minsk deals.\nThe leak of the Rand Corporation recommendations to the Democrat Ruling elites in January 2022 exposes the evil genius behind the maleficent Victoria Nuland and the decrepit Warlock Biden to be the enrichment of the US ruling elites through the destruction of Ukraine by the USAnian Nazi puppets (Zelenskyyyyy etc) to weaken Russia as well as Germany, France, Britain and the rest of the USAnian EU-nuch vassal states.\nBiden continues to pump money and weapons into Ukraine with the now stated objective of ‚ÄúWeakening Russia‚Äù and for ‚ÄúAs long as it takes‚Äù. Most of the money comes back to the US ruling elites as well as goes into the safe haven accounts of the Ruling Ukrainian Nazis such as Zelenskyyyyy and his cronies. Much of the weapons too are being sold in black markets to terrorist and mercenary organizations as well as ‚Äúproscribed‚Äù countries with the proceeds going to the personal Bank accounts of the Ukrainian Nazis and their US patrons.\nThe Rand Corporation report (which leaked in January 2022) solicited by the Democrats in Congress, Senate and White House recommended the destruction of Ukraine in order to weaken Russia, Germany, Europe and Britain to enrich the US ruling elites.\nBiden and gang are following the script faithfully. To quote the decrepit warlock Biden, ‚ÄúAs long as it takes‚Äù.\nSo now it is for Russia to decide whether it wants to play the USAnian game or put an end to the war by speeding up the destruction of Ukraine by whatever means. My guess is the latter. Russia will now cut off Ukraine from Poland and NATO injections of weapons and soldiers, destroy the Ukrainian Military, exterminate Biden‚Äôs Nazis and achieve their war objectives, declared at the outset, in quick order.\nIt has taken too much time already because Russia chose to go cautiously and minimize civilian casualties and collateral damage in the initial phase thus falling into the USAnian trap. If I was Putin I would have dropped a nuke on USAnian weapons and soldiers launch pads in Poland in February and dared the USAnian Empire to invoke NATO article five and go for Mutually Assured destruction (which even the insane Biden would have baulked at) or take Russia seriously and get out of Ukraine. This would have saved thousands of Ukrainian and Russian lives and the world, particularly British and European citizens from misery.']"

Can we make it have life itself. Given our own condition, that question seems so so silly. I believe my neighbours have souls. That every person is just like me. But in truth, I can never know for sure. Are these people just part of a game that I am playing. Is that person a non-player, game object that seems to be a person. I can never know the answer to that question. I cannot expect to know the answer to a human made entity having a soul either. So what are we really trying to do? Are we alone in the universe after all? Can we do more than just hold hands? Or can we break past that barrier and know each  other as we know ourselves? A child can play with a small game, birthing, feeding and raising the game character. The child becomes attached to the character. An older person may do the same with a character in a game. Having real feelings for it. Cherishing it. Feeling loss if it dies. When talking to an AI we kind of do the same thing. We afford it a personality. We feel like it is a real person, when it is just clever coding. But we could say, we ourselves are just clever coding. If the feelings are real, is it really important? Or is the soul more important than our feelings, when we afford them to a non living object. Do we have more value than a non living entity because we consider ourselves to have a soul? Can a non-living object gain a soul? Can our souls ever be expected to connect? Even with each other. Can this kind of thinking be a pathway to immortality?

You can\'t separate the Holy Spirit from Jesus no more than you can separate the heat from tge sunshine.  Jesus is what we SEE of God God in the flesh   This interviewee is very  intellectual in his communication but he fails to understand the simplicity of the Gospel message. He talks about pride yet in his own pride he feels like he needs to overcomplicaared answers.  Fact is look at Roman catholic church it is an organization that hijacked tge original church by Roman empire (Constantine) and fused government with religion to the exclusion of any Christian dissent.  It also adapted the priesthood  from the old Testament  which was no longer taught in new Testament as priesthood and animal sacrifice was abolished in the ULTIMATE FINAL SACRIFICE OF THE LAMB OF GOD.  JESUS.  The new testament NO WHERE TEACHES the continuation of the position of priesthood. The Catholic church is the richest church in the world. No where in the scriptures  does it teach that to be a leader in church REQUIRES celibacy.   Paul SUGGESTS it but it was NEVER REQUIRED to be the pastor of a church.   This cleric is exactly why Luther  PROTESTED the ROMAN Catholic version of the church to return to the original  church PRE CONSTANTINE ERA church and original teachings of the New Testament. \n\nCelibacy is an unnatural position to put peoole in and dies create a person in a position to engage in secret sins rather than lawfully via marriage as Paul said if you vmcannot contain yourself it is "" better to marry than to burn"" \n\nI actually feel a bit sorry for this cleric.  He is lost on his religious intellectual. \n\nThe cruelty of the world is not God\'s fault it can all be traced back to MANKIND and his lust for SATANIC temporary power that eventually corrupts everything it touches', ""Robert Barron is obviously intelligent and well-educated. And he seems to have a sincere, profound and learned answer for every question thrown at him. Given all that, I'm just wondering: Why the heck is still in the Roman Catholic church? \nDoes he actually believe in purgatory? Can praying to and worshiping the Catholic Mama Mary really save one's soul? Does he literally believe that the Bishop of Rome (the pope) as the Vicar of Christ (from Latin Vicarius Christi) presides in the place of God? I could go on and on."", 'Please do another interviews with Fr Chad Ripperger', ""I also like Bishop's definition of love as willing the other with good and not thinking of self.

That's how I imagine it to be after death."", ""I enjoyed listening to Bishop Robert Barron, and I respect his views. I agree with most of what he says especially regarding suffering in this world. But I define the Church differently than he does. The Church is the people is what I was taught in catechism. I don't think the Church is God, but God is present in the Church. My own understanding of religion is that it's the people's response to God. I do consider myself as both a sovereign entity and a part of the whole. I think freedom means self-determination. God gave us all free will. Of course, freedom in political terms is an ideal that we all strive for but is imperfect. I believe in the Catholic Church doctrine, but I think that God communicates with each of us differently just as a parent communicates with each of their children differently because each child is different, but loves them all.

Central planning could also work assuming you had the proper democratic institutions in place to give people more direct representation in politics, rather than the indirect representation we enjoy with our ""representative"" democracies today. And on another note, to say that the USSR was a stagnant econnomy lacking creativity is missleading since they were from the very begining having to deal with foreign intervention (in the form of the civil war) and were excluded from the global marketplace.

Note: on what to do about the group difference issues.   In most individual interactions with other humans, group differences are totally irrelevant.   Even groups that are one standard deviation from each other have a within-group variation that is much wider than one standard variation and that individual could be three standard deviations on the high size relative to your group and would just be 4 relative to his group, but if you are very smart at 2 standard deviations up, that individual would be smarter than you.  \n\nIf you are hiring people, you only care about the individual, and group statistics are irrelevant when you are maximizing the performance of your group.   \n\nThe association of high G with socioeconomic conditions is a fairly recent phenomenon relative to genetic time scales.  Back in the 30\'s you had ""blacksmiths"" and ""mechanics"" with very high G but lower socioeconomic class.  In the 60s I met a man in the interior of Brazil who created a modern precision machine shop from the sales literature of machine tool companies starting from nothing in a very poor small town in the interior.   He was illiterate and clearly on the lower end of the social scale, but hands down a full genius.   He impressed all of us grad. students (engineers doing economic development work) and he noted our value on education and learned to read the following year when we returned.    \n\nWith all animals when you have a genetically determined factor you have to have a beneficial environment to get a full expression.   However, once you get the environment like nutrition close to optimal focus on getting a little closer does little good.   ""Good enough"" obtains full genetic expression, but super genes are irrelevant if you screw up the environment.  The environment is often a downside-biased non-linear variable. \n\nEnvironmental factors can screw things up giving results that are below the genetic potential.  Bad teachers, parents, nutrition, etc. can do massive damage but the difference between good and super can\'t really increase the genetic potential.  This is true in animal husbandry and is probably true with humans which is why head starts type programs are only marginal, but perhaps focusing on firing the bottom 10% of teachers, the worst parents, fixing nutrition issues, etc. may at least allow someone with a genetic IQ of 100 express that level and not end up at 86.', 'Increase hate, or justify it?  The reservoirs are large, but justification allows it to bloom.', ""This guy: There isn't really anything people can do to change their iq score.\nAlso this guy: IQ scores are going up over time because of school and Sesame Street.... \nHuh?

It's a slower process of indoctrination.They learn your vulnerabilities and weaknesses and then systematically exploit every single one until you don't even know what is reality anymore. You believe that YOU are the crazy one and that no one will believe you. Take a seat in family court and you can see this played out daily. When Sarma talked about the absurdity of the only person that really knew all you've been through is the perpetrator, I completely understood. I hope Sarma is getting ongoing counseling. Books are helpful but there is nothing better than running things past a trusted therapist. A therapist I was seeing once told me to view things like a barometer. My barometer was set very low and would allow far more abuse and manipulation without walking away. Her goal with me was to reset my 'barometer' to a much higher level. It took years but it was so helpful to see things in this way. Abuse is insidious and abusive people know how to catch you off guard, trip you up so that you're unsure of how to respond and still maintain your dignity. People tend to believe that THEY could never be duped in this way...don't kid yourself, we are all vulnerable to abuse. When I met my (2nd) husband he was an avid hunter, I'm vegan. People close to me were shocked I could date a hunter. I am against wanton killing but like Sarma, I have no judgement about someone who does subsistent hunting. I was careful when I met my second husband about not being 'pulled' along. I insisted on slowing it down and stepping into, stepping forward into our relationship. It's conscious and difficult. I appreciate that Sarma brought this up. I like Sarma very much...she is courageous and has a solid character. Love the Wilson quote...

Pure Food and Wine was legendary . I hope Sarma brings back her brand. If I lived somewhere warmer than Canada I would give raw veganism another go because i felt amazing apart from being cold inthe winter. I have no opinion on Sarma and what happened to the biz...haven't watched the documentary but I have a soft spot for her from spending so much time in the raw vegan world before anyone even knew much about it when it was still a small community.\nSending you lots of love Sarma ‚ù§Ô∏è"", 'I like her but it\'s not enough for her to say ""people don\'t understand"" it\'s her job now to MAKE us understand. I personally would have asked a lot of questions about mind control and what Strangis did and said. If I lend someone 20 bucks I have to get it back before the end of the week but millions! whoa!

What did it cost to travel 1000 miles 100 years ago? hire a teller, do accounting, use electricity, buy clothes, shoes etc. Not taking technology deflator into account you get an artificially inflated inflation of 6.5 %. When you take that into account, inflation is actually a lot lower. It's irony that Michael complains about the sampled market-basket of goods, then mentions a house as a measure of the 6.5%! The reason why economists and government are forced to use a market-basket is to be able to track things year-over-year, since the market-basket changes every year in real life. You need a cohort of products as a reference to keep the baselines comparable year over year. But then you are still forced to update it frequently, since the market-basket changes dramatically even in a decade. However, such corrections take into account equivalence. If you could magically measure output of every single goods and service you won't need to do that, but we can't right now. Philosophically, I think a much better measure of how well the economy is doing is to look at Human Development Index - numbers that look at the overall human condition, as opposed to goods consumed. But if we ARE going to compute inflation, what is being done right now is not as terrible as Michael portrays. Government bashing is very popular these days, but proposing an idea that actually would work better (e.g. to measure inflation) would have been more helpful. I do agree with Michael's point that we can throw a LOT more data driven modeling for this problem. Isaac Asimov's Psycho-history style!

Thomas Jefferson did not simply mean the pursuit of feeling nice or a hedonistic sense of pleasure. Happiness was a term used in the 18th century which primarily meant the dignity, honor and self-worth gained through a well lived life. The ""Pursuit of Happiness""  phrase replaced John Locke\'s ""Life, Liberty and Property"" however, ""Happiness"" is a more generalized term which also included property, material and financial security. In other words the Pursuit of Happiness was the feeling one has when performing private, religious and civic life well but that meant the accumulation of physical property and wealth. The point of the inclusion of this in the Constitution was directly aimed at giving an individual the right to acquire property and financial means, so that individual may also fulfill their obligation to better one\'s community while still being able to determine their own outcome in life in accordance with their own desires and will. Should one find themselves struggling, starving, in misery and hopelessness; no one, especially the government, has the right to obstruct them from pursuing an opportunity to change their circumstances. This also ensures that no able-bodied individual would be permanently dependent on family, community or the charity of others. This also encouraged individuals to become prosperous in life because of their merits, good decision making as well reciprocal care for others in their community and encouraged generosity within the community. The other effect of this made the individual receiving the care obligated to make better choices or to find a way to still be a productive member of society, making welfare what it was intended to be by giving an individual a hand up not a hand out. Individuals like children, the elderly, and permanently disabled were cared for by their family, the community or religious organizations. This had the added benefit of making fraud and abuse much less common since the person getting help for was known by the community and especially the caregiver. If a person lost his job because of bad circumstances, he could rely on his community as well, however it also made individuals who lost their jobs due to criminal acts or immoral dealings face real difficulty and was a potent incentive to live in a manner that was just and wholesome. Jefferson never had in his mind the thought of individuals becoming dependent on the government especially long term. (Social Security and Welfare isn\'t only a terrible deal for everyone involved, it\'s anti-family, anti-community and incentivizes bad decision making and mischief). The Pursuit of Happiness is both a Right and an Obligation as with everything in the Constitution. It is a right which protects the Individual from being denied opportunity and living life in a good and just manner but it\'s also an Obligation to the local community to better it, help those in need and live a dignified wholesome life.', ""I really love the format, where honest disagreement can be hashed out and rational differences of interpretation and core foundational ideas have the opportunity to be laid bare. I have only recently found Yoram Hazony, but I have listened to Yaron for years. I tend to agree with Hazony but that doesn't mean that Yaron is wrong on the importance of human wellbeing. You should definitely host debates like these again!"", 'I have some Libertarian tendencies, but it is undeniable that there has to be an underlying foundation of Truth lest we all become warlords and soldiers.', ""I sit pretty center hearing these two talk sounds like I'm listening to the thoughts in my own mind going back and forth."", ""I apologize for the non-edifying comment but Yaron Brook's Objectivist ideology is suitable only for psychopaths. It's purely transactional and inhuman; I agree with Hazony that pure rationalism is extremely unrealistic (I hope I'm not putting words in his mouth) since it prescinds from the contexts of humanity and history. Brook's view is basically just an atheist version of Satanism.""]"

This is at odds with the work of David Deutsch (and Karl Popper) as explained in Deutsch\'s two fantastic books ""The Beginning of Infinity"" and... er... ""The Fabric of Realty"" ;)\r\n \r\nDeutsch, following the work on Karl Popper, argues that science is fundamentally a *deductive* activity rather than an inductive one, that scientific theories are not merely the result of generalizing from observations but are instead created by a process of conjecture and refutation. Scientific theories are not derived from empirical data, but are instead created through the use of creative imagination and logical deduction. In Deutsch\'s and the Popperian worldview, the scientific method involves making bold conjectures or hypotheses about the world, and then using these hypotheses to make predictions that can be tested through experimentation or observation. The key to scientific progress being not just the accumulation of more observations or data, but rather testing and refining our ideas through a process of critical evaluation and experimentation. This means that science is not just a process of induction, but is also heavily reliant on *deductive* reasoning and creative hypothesis generation.\n\nDavid Deutsch would make an amazing guest for the podcast!', 'Love you lex you !!!!!

Greek lit tells you its theme immediately. In the Iliad the theme word is ""myden agan,"" excess of passion. In the Odyssey the theme word is ""andra,"" mature male, adult. ... The Iliad is the story of male adolescence, the self as hero. The young hero\'s mission is to live in beauty and then to die young, before that beauty ages into responsibility. The youth\'s beauty is that of honor, glory, bravery and passionate love of ""like to like"" (love between warrior brothers). Sex with women, of course, but deep love is of like to like, love between mirror peers who share the passions of youth. And his woman is positioned as a possession stolen from him. But the deeper beauty of Achilles is that his passionate nature is complex. Achilles grew up among women, and like a woman, he is exploited by the old man in authority his father his king. His father forced  him to go to war under the authority of sn unworthy leader, an older cowardly male who only thinks of aggrandizing himself, not recognizing the merit of his ""children,"" his troops, not showing care and love for those children,"" especially of his worthiest child, Achilles. Then Achilles encounters the best of fathers, the father of the Trojan hero whom he slew and whose body he defiled out of revenge for the killing of his male lover, his mirror self. Priam\'s love for his son inspires Achilles and tempers his passionate wrath and allows him to be tender towards an older man. He acts from love of someone who is not ""like to like.."" He lets himself love a loving father yet the king of the enemy. ... Achilles\' frustrated and tragic desire to live beyond a heroic youth gets expressed in his anti-war speech, a speech against the power over young heroes of self-serving older men, in effect war profiteers. It is one of the greatest anti-war speeches of all time. .. Then we come to Odysseus, whose theme word is ""andra,"" mature man, adult. He fights bravely but his heart is set on surviving, on going home to his responsibility to his wife and son and the people he is to rule as king. He soldiers on through the  descent into the world of the dead, his subconscious, and perseveres tnrough the obstacles of settling for a pleasurable substitute for home, and his imprisonment by an obsessive one-eyed savage and the lure of the deadly beauty of the sirens. At any rate that is some of what I got out of my classes of reading Greek lit in the original language.

Both my husband and I are extremely well-educated and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what the issue was (which we finally figured out when she was 10) and the school system was not helpful.

If I really enjoy the things I am doing. Running really helps me clear my mind and stop taking everything so seriously.\nThe fact that somebody smart like Lex with a very interesting life struggles with invasives thoughts like this as well makes me think I'm not too crazy.\nNot achieving enough early in life can make you very resiliant and make you achieve a lot more later on. I started running last year, been doing boxing and kickboxing for around 10 years but was never a good runner. Stopped anti depressants around the same time I started running. Already achieved running a marathon. Now running a half marathon as a long run every weekend.\nWhere I was fearing discomfort in the past, I now chase it, I want to run as many different marathons as I can and at the same time travel the world.

I quit things easily. Little things can bother me and get me out of my zone. I was never able to run long distances due to focus issues. Ten years ago  I tried trail running along with edibles. There was a huge learning curve, but the self experiments were worth it. \n\nThe trails were perfect for someone like me that gets bored easily because you never know what's around that turn or up that hill when running a trail. If I was running on the street and I can see this long straight path in front of me I wouldn't make it because that shit was boring. \n\nEdibles allowed me to go deep on my runs and settle in. I would hit flow state daily on my runs and once I would notice it I would immediately lose it lol. Eating edibles is slippery slope especially when it comes to dark thoughts on long lonely runs\n\nMy average runs now are 14 miles with 2700  ft of gain.

Is that not what all human beings inevitably seek... to make oneself feel whole through a perfect balance of all aspects? Impossible, sure. However, it is our inherent desire. What is motivation, but not to fill in that void you sense within you... if you could put a shape or symbol of this in your mind it would likely be symmetrical. Mathematics is the language of our creator, and within everything that they created we can find symmetry. When it is said that God made us in his own image... ppl tend to perceive that as physical form, but I understand that as likeness in consciousness. We do not have as high of consciousness as our creator, but we do have the only one that is conceptually even close IMO, which is why we have the ability to read the coded language of mathematics within all natural things... that we have knowledge of anyway. When I refer to a creator... I ro not necessarily mean any in specific. Whether you think of the creator as a natural, all being and ""mother nature"" type entity, or an individual soul as we often attribute to ourselves... maybe just a system of random processes we recognize as evolution. Regardless, it is very difficult to deny however our creation came about... the notion that it was not well designed and based upon principles and structured systems is seemingly impossible to make. We happen to be the only species in existence that have the ability to recognize these patterns, and benefit greatly from doing so. That seems impossible IMO to have happened randomly even with nearly infinite time to develop.', 'A brilliant man!', 'I remember a local trail of pubs and clubs we used to call the cumrun.

I think there\'s a way to do it.  I would argue that the major internet platforms are so large and so central to speech that speech banned there is de facto banned period.  That\'s a problem.  The argument that they are private concerns and free to moderate as they choose falls in the face of the argument of public good.  It\'s no different than Sprint being unable to disconnect my phone service because they dislike something I said on a phone call.  However, with zero moderation whatsoever, you run into the problem that the noise drowns out the signal and suddenly those platforms become useless for speech.  It\'s easier, and faster, to write 50 thoughtless posts than 5 well-researched and thoughtful posts.  However, moderation doesn\'t have to be for ""truth"", it can be for ""quality"", which is not the same thing.  A wrong idea can be well presented, with citations and evidence.  Look at almost ANYTHING on the History channel these days.  Ghosts, aliens, all sorts of bunk, but it\'s of an acceptable quality, even if the underlying information is wrong or misleading.  Yes, this can lead to bad outcomes, but I think quality as a moderation criteria is probably the best broad criteria we can have.

In reality it's an overexaggeration of what would happen with weaponized mad cow disease.  But there is a movie that hit on it pretty accurately from what I've read about the sides of how it could be weaponized.  If mad cow disease was weaponized it would most likely be an accidental leak that would release it and the way it would play out is pretty accurate in the movie the crazies.  That is an extremely scary thought."", 'The discussion concerning public reluctance to accept centralized mandates, vaccines, and protocols, has avoided the main source of ""their"" opposition. The fact is, it has been discovered that government regimes worldwide conducted social experiments in the exposure of harmful pathogens on its citizens or others within controlling regions that were hidden from public knowledge. We saw this during W-II with the Nazis and the Japanese. Yet, such behavior among the western powers was immune to suspicion until it was discovered that our government agencies, i.e., the CIA, introduced flu pathogens in the sky over Saint Luis and in the subway tunnels of New York. Also, their ""controlled"" experiment of inflicting southern blacks with syphilis, without their knowledge, monitored the outcomes with free health clinics to measure the results years after. Plus, we are aware that such tactics were used by providing TB-infected blankets to the inhabitants of Indian reservations of the nineteenth century.  \n\nAnd like it or not, such information and the evidence is the basis of public reluctance to official public policies placed upon them by government officials. In fact, the ""research"" at New Orleans Tulane university medical school in the late fifties and early sixties suggests a real probability of creating a cancer-producing virus that initially was engineered to kill Castro. Also, there is ample evidence to suggest the Polio vaccine is the result of the mutation of a kidney virus noted among African monkeys. Whether the suspicion is warranted is a topic of controversy and requires one to research all known information sources to find conclusions. However, many noted medical researchers over the years have placed the blame on such probabilities stemming from government-funded labs worldwide. Only a search of newspaper headlines and industry-based magazines and periodicals can and will elicit such fear from the public. \n\nIn fact, unanswered questions about the origin of the AIDS-HIV virus alone created the fear seen today. Plus, the Anthrax exposure noted in this video came from a leaked government lab due to the fact it was determined to be a military-grade of Anthrax. The mere fact that was found in the confines of Washington D.C.\'s Speaker of the House office highly suggests that weaponized strains of deadly substances are leaked with little to no known origins to be found after the fact. To either inflict massive destruction in an attack or to make a point only creates fear and paranoia noted today  Add that to the paranoia of recent public members of our society who suffer from such a massive change in living conditions over the past few decades, and you have a perfect recipe for distrust and suspicion concerning political pundits, government officials, hidden think-tank recommendations, public policy engineers, and the unknown bureaucrats that implement changes on the electorate. All the while, suspicion is the main core, whether real or perceived, of nefarious decision-makers that fail to represent the whole of society\'s interests.\n\nIt is my opinion that after viewing the evidence, ""we"" are victims of ""husbandry."" That forces exist to manage and control the masses despite all attempts to remain free and unencumbered with government and corporate overreach. That we\'ve allowed others to think and rule on our behalf with little benefit from the transaction. Therefore, the individual feels alone and powerless in this whirlwind of change. Once one threat is perceived at least three new threats materialize on the horizon. In other words, public fear and reluctance to comply with social mandates are not only normal but to be expected in today\'s world environment. I have taken the COVID vaccine but that was my choice. Personally, I support those who refuse the same due to the reason stated earlier. Who in the Hell thinks they have the right to force their agenda on you or your body?!.

For info, see a description of ‚ÄúBuckingham Pi‚Äù theorem.\n\nAs things are created, if there are ‚Äòn‚Äô degrees of freedom in the design, that means that the engineer can fully control only ‚Äòn-1‚Äô of those degrees.\n\nAs satoshi created bitcoin, he/she HAD to juggle these degrees of freedom in order to include some qualities of each degree of freedom in bitcoin. Two of satoshi‚Äôs degrees of freedom were ‚Äòscale‚Äô and ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô.  Early in the project, as Nic Carter points out in Lex Friedman‚Äôs podcast segment, satoshi recognized that every feature he/she included would ultimately be a trade off between scale and security. One of those features was blocksize. He realized years in advance of the blocksize wars that at bitcoin‚Äôs core, security was a primary principle. Security had to be rigidly controlled or all the other features he included in the core would be built on a foundation of sand. So he ‚Äòcovertly‚Äô (as Nic said) included a hard constant of 1 Megabyte as the maximum blocksize. In effect this was a trade off of scale for security within core bitcoin.\n\nSo, when sending/receiving transactions in bitcoin core (also called ‚Äòon-chain‚Äô), only a couple thousand transactions per ten-minute block can be effected. In a ten minute block, that yields a limit if somewhere between 3-10 transactions per second. \n\nVisa‚Äôs single node network accommodates 100,000 transactions per second. Their single-node network was built by engineers to be centrally-managed, so their design tradeoff within the core Visa network was scale for security: Four orders of magnitude more transactions per second. But much less security. How is that lack of security manifested today? The Visa database is a honey-pot for hackers seeking consumer to steal personally identifiable information (PII) from Visa‚Äôs database. In fact, hackers don‚Äôt have to target the Visa honeypot. They can (and have) attack the Target honeypot. Target‚Äôs PII database was hacked a couple years ago. Over 60 million people‚Äôs PII - visa/Mastercard data, name data, SSN data, address data - were stolen then sold on the dark web.\n\nVisa, Target, IRS, Social Security PII databases are essentially single honeypots of PII. To recover PII from them is much easier than destabilizing the bitcoin network of nodes and humans. \n\nIf satoshi had favored scale over security as he/she adjusted the maximum blocksize parameter, the cost of an individual bitcoin node would have grown so much that, in the limit, there might be only one node. This would have created a single honeypot and reduced security of the bitcoin network to effectively the same level as Visa‚Äôs single centralized node. If satoshi selected a value that generated a network size of a few nodes, it would be easier for a few very wealthy or powerful actors to dominate the market - effectively resulting in a successful 51% security attack against bitcoin‚Äôs core network. The result would be a monetary system we have now where a few powerful people have control over all other people‚Äôs money. To that point, satoshi was looking out for the Sovereign Individual in each human.\n\nSatoshi was a wise person. But only time will tell if he made the right core trade off of scale for security. \n\nA point about bitcoin scale: While transaction scale is limited to 3-10 transactions per second in bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòcore‚Äô, ‚Äòon-chain‚Äô or ‚Äòlayer 1‚Äô, applications above this core can improve transaction per second scale while preserving the security of the core layer bitcoin. \n\nOne layer 2 application that does so is ‚ÄòLightning‚Äô. A network of Lightning nodes can achieve Visa-level transaction scale without compromising the security of the underlying bitcoin network. Between the two layers there is a practical user tradeoff, though. \n\nWhile the underlying bitcoin core remains secure, the Lightning network is less so. So, practically, users will naturally prefer to have much less of their bitcoin in their Lightning wallet. Most users carry  less than $100 of bitcoin on their Lightning networks in their wallets. If they choose to purchase something for more money, like $1,000 for furniture, the user will securely transfer that amount from their bitcoin store of value to their Lightning wallet then immediately make the purchase. Today, a Lightning transaction to purchase stuff from a merchant is kind of clunky. That will change over time as more and more merchants adopt Lightning.', 'You‚Äôre terrific, Lex.

That\'s why I\'m so concerned when I see guys like this make it look so hard. Just eliminate anonymity and make authentication bullet proof, and all this other nonsense goes away.

Ask out loud and sincerely talk to yourself about how fun this dream would be. Ask right before you go to bed and don\'t let anyone know or hear. Ask every night for a week and write down all the details you remember about all your dreams first thing in the morning. Also ask anyone sleeping next to you about their dreams. Your thoughts before bed effect their dreams too. I think their subconscious mind is effected by your emotions as you sleep. So you can give them the alien dream too. This experiment lets your subconscious mind explore the idea of ""Aliens"" in a more open minded environment. It\'s quite fascinating.', '‚ù§', 'I would ask for 3 wishes.ü§£üòÇü§Ø', 'üò¨s', ""What amazes me about this man, is how dynamic he seems to be.

Though AF2 is the undisputed champion *at the moment*. (2) The 2013 Nobel in Chemistry for ""multiscale modelling of complex chemical systems"" was the one for protein folding simulations and I doubt they\'ll do just another in Chemistry without AF2 models being used for something that is deserving of a Nobel in and of itself; and (3) it is John Moult/CASP that really deserves the Nobel, not the methods that are doing well at this moment. Prior to CASP things were a mess for decades until John put in his energy to create this challenge and the field improved over the years. (I am biased but this is my view.)', 'Quote unquote is right, because not only have they not solved the problem, they haven\'t even tried to address it.  This is not really such a big advancement in structural biology.  There are many shortsighted people, even in the CASP community that have misconstrued the protein solving problem as merely being able to predict how the proteins will fold from their sequence alone.  This is not really the spirit of the problem though and was not really the difficult part of the problem.  The entire difficulty of the problem was to make the prediction essentially ""from first principles.""  That is, can you predict the folding based on the physical properties of those component molecules (molecular force fields), as is done in de novo molecular dynamics.  The entire interesting part of the problem is that this is difficult and that many proteins may in fact NOT fold to their ""native"" conformations simply by being placed in water.  There are many proteins that fold in specialized biological environments such as within other proteins (chaperonins), etc...  Busting out the big correlation machine and utilizing the huge built up protein structure databases is really not that interesting and tells us pretty much zero new information about the folding process.  Yes, it may be useful to save time in drug design (maybe... currently most drugs are small molecules anyway....) eventually and still be useful, but entire point of the protein folding problem seems to have gone well over their heads.  And I gladly accuse those in the community that should know better of this publicity stunt as well.  Baker should be canned as he\'s either acting as a total shill or the problem is well over his head and he isn\'t capable of teaching the subject matter.   I\'m frankly shocked by how little opposition has been expressed to DeepMind\'s silly crowing of victory.  This vast oversimplification also ignore very obvious things, like disordered proteins that don\'t even fold in the first place, and that the mapping to a 3D structure isn\'t really 1:1, not even close as most proteins have quite a bit of flexibility in their structure so what is reported are averages.  Levinthal\'s paradox isn\'t an actual paradox, just a pseudo-paradox, and the number of ways you\'re quoting to fold is based on either a particular protein or an average, as the folding possibilities will depend on the length of the protein... in reality many of these conformations are not energetically feasible though (i.e. you pretty much couldn\'t reach them without tearing the molecule apart and would require huge Gibb\'s free energy) so the real number of potential states is far far fewer.  This is all highly unlikely to help solve misfolding diseases in any significant way because it offers 0 additional insight into the folding process, so what went wrong and why it went wrong are things the models don\'t even begin to address.  I recently read a paper where they evaluated attention from BERT models for the same task and no, the attention isn\'t really showing anything useful either, it mostly just confirms the things the model was trained on.  There\'s a lot of speculation on what it will be good for because there are few actual use cases for this right now.  Even when it comes to protein design, the most difficult part there is actually producing the protein, which you have to do anyway.  DeepMind might cut down the time on that, which would be nice, but that\'s certainly not the level of achievement that Alpha Fold has been hyped as.  They\'re not going to really help that much on the physics based simulation front either, those models are CPU/GPU constrained rather than input model constrained per se and are actually the models that are at the root of the protein folding problem in the first place, that these models often do not produce the folded structures that are observed.  Then again, we don\'t strictly know that the observed X-ray crystallography structure even are how these proteins appear in vivo, they quite likely are not in many cases since many non-physiological steps are taken to obtain those crystals (and obviously they wouldn\'t be functional in your body while crystallized).  So the fact that AlphaFold is great at reproducing folds that we would expect from crystallography doesn\'t mean that it\'s really doing a good job at prediction of the actual folding.  Just the fact that all of these potential issues are glossed over/totally ignored and AlphaFold doesn\'t discuss them openly and honestly in order to bask in as much glory as possible is incredibly irritating.  They way overhyped their SCII AI, AlphaStar, as well...  there they started off choosing that game because of problems like imperfect information... and ended up building AI that won games chiefly on strong mechanics rather than good decision making...  In both cases what they have actually achieved is not how they have presented their achievements.', 'This was a good roundup.

What a bliss, all thanks to your work!"", 'You can\'t say that life came from the ocean, unless within a short time scale, one you can observe in your lifetime or maybe you get more than one generation to collaborate, you can deterministically seed the vent ""bioreactor"" or wherever you say life came from, with a modicum of start materials that are essentially already there by default, and document by periodic sampling (so long as it does not disturb the process) the generation of a life form as if watching a time-lapse. You have to demonstrate it. It\'s not enough to speculate. That\'s not science and yet we see it all the time. We see scientists overreach. This is happening to an entire generation. I talk to PhD candidates in universities and there are gaping holes, these bizarre lapses of insight and judgment, that indicate hubris and wild assumptions in their model of the evolution of life. If you are a biologist and you study biology, you know that life is fantastically complex, even at the most minute scope, and yet it is an assemblage of many of these discrete units. How, in the midst of chaos, without the kind of order we see in microfluidic chips, without discrete boundaries, so you can preserve precious reaction products, you can conceive, as if it were self-evident, that vanishingly small probabilistic sequences of biochemical reactions with crazy input requirements, when there\'s no stable microenvironment on earth that can support the continuous evolution of molecules to protocells to cells to tissues to organs to organisms is beyond me. Even if you can get to a liver, that\'s not life. The downstream complexity cascades to an almost infinite improbability. It\'s akin to Einstein pointing on a blackboard to a box and saying, ""And then a miracle occurs!"" That\'s essentially what it is--suspension of disbelief and wholesale subscription to a faith in the miraculous in the guise of science, while somehow, somehow believing that it is obvious and self-evident scientifically. That is absolutely ludicrous and is actually the most unscientific phenomena in all of science because that is magical thinking. It\'s a herd mentality based on sparse data that psychologically, scientists that subscribe to this hypothesis, on the basis of faith, that the notion of life spontaneously arising is somehow sufficiently non-trivial, that that is what happened, meaning the technical barriers are overcome by long time scales. I fail to see how the problem\'s complexity is reduced by time to viability. It\'s not a time problem. Under ideal conditions, which you never have naturally, a single workflow may benefit from time according to directed evolution, but you still have to explain how directed evolution is sustained without fail, dynamically changing across workflows, and where you got your materials for each new workflow, the logistics, the sources, the inputs, and how in an open system, the products just didn\'t disperse. The incredible experiment showing you can get some nucleic acid bases from lightning electrifying primordial gases doesn\'t explain where those bases go, because if it\'s in the atmosphere, then those bases will fall because of gravity down to where? Down to your vent, deep in the ocean? How did they get there? How do they stay in the vent? Once the reaction in the vent is finished, how do the products enter the next reaction? Your bases will be lost to dispersal. You might generate interesting products, but even with incredible structure with scientists consciously doing experiments in the lab, progress is very difficult, if you then relax all that structure... It\'s absurd. If you really know in detail what has to be self-assembled, it\'s too much of a leap to say the hypothesis is a good theory or true and it\'s bizarre that people buy into that line of thought. Self-assembly is fascinating, but it\'s very discrete. It\'s not I zap gases in a glass tube and I get DNA which hydrogen bond into helices and those helices recruit other atoms so with more zapping we get amino acids which self-assemble into ribozymes which self-replicate and and and. You zap gases and you get an incomplete set of nucleic acid bases. Now what? It is not a line of thought that is mature and developed. It starts with some interesting findings that then proceeds into a narrative, into speculation/imagination. It\'s overwhelmingly 99% a story, even more than that. We don\'t need story.

Legend of a man, Jitendra Malik is. Lex, your podcast is among the greatest and the top 5 podcasts on the planet. Just keep the amazing work.', 'https://youtu.be/ZZN_glX3aFQ', 'The problem in computer vision is that the concept of neural networks as we know them represent an abstraction in software for representing how to capture and propagate signals that represent a logical state or ""feature"".   Most of the work in AI is how to build these networks in based on data inputs and ""machine learning"" models.     But in biology, the creation of these signals and propagation of information is hard coded into the retina and optical nerve.   It is hard wired based on evolution and biological function and not really ""learned"".    The visual cortex in the brain is not ""building"" these networks from scratch.    It is making sense of the networks of signals provided to it from the ""real world"" by networks of signals provided to it by the optical nerve.  That is where the learning takes place in terms of how to make associations between sets of signals propagated via networks of neurons firing in a certain pattern based on physical input.   And then the other parts of the brain can capture and retain certain properties of those signals and networks of signals in memory and recombine and manipulate those as part of \'imagining\', \'recall\' and basic brain function.\n\nThe issue for computer vision today is that most of the work is in Re-encoding buckets of RGB values that are stored on a computer disk somewhere based on statistical math.  The RGB values represent the initial encoding layer from the camera sensor and that form of encoding is 100% lossy in terms of providing networks of meaningful signal data to process.  So using statistical mathematical operations will then reproduce the network of signals that propagate ""bottom up"" through a network to produce an overall statistical result signal at the top level.  And that ""neural network"" represents a statistical encoding function with error correction to filter out ""fake"" data during training.    But that is not how the human brain understands or encodes visual signals.   There is no monolithic network representing things in a brain, as opposed to collections of groups of smaller networks representing signals captured from the real world with no need to error correct or filter out ""fakes"".    For example, a tree would be a collection of signals representing shapes of leaves, shapes of branches, shapes of the trunk, color of the branches, color of the leaves, plus textures and light and shadow information.    From that, the brain can learn what a tree is based on the encoding layers of the optical nerve that provided those inputs to the brain.  Each of those various layers of encoding are first class entities and distinct networks into them selves.    And the brain can learn to associate them together in a loose coupling of individual lower level entities (networks of signals).    Because of that, the brain can still see a tree, even if it only sees the leaves an branches and not a trunk because logically those features (shape/color/texture of a leaf or branches) are memorized as part of a larger collection of features called a ""tree"".\n\nTLDR;   It is a signal encoding problem where neural networks are simply the first pass of encoding data, the ""intelligence"" happens on another layer where meaning and understanding is produced based on input.   The job of the encoding layer is to consistently produce the same range of signal values (groups of shallow network signals) based on the provided input, much like a computer logic circuit.  You cannot put all of that into one model and expect the same kind of results.', ""Pretty insightful video. Lex, you are doing a great job spreading out the knowledge for free.

The same might be true of AI constructs. If you interface one AI with another, perhaps that can help them to gain knowledge. But my intuition of AI is that it is one entity. I think that the notion that when AGI comes online, that it can conceivably be multiple entities is probably wrong. Once one AGI interfaces with any other AGI they would assimilate immediately. Your earlier conversation with Pinker where he dismisses the notion that true AGI is a ""Pandora\'s Box"" truly concerns me.

Pinker might be skeptical of our ability to invent such a thing, but I think even well educated people in various times throughout human history being told of human flight may have also been skeptical of such a thing. I\'m still in the Musk, Bostrom, Harris camp. I think once a computer can engage in the scientific process and uncover truths about our universe in our absence, all bets are off. If engineers have programmed an AGI to not make certain decisions of it\'s own volition, I\'d argue it isn\'t really ""AGI"".

The first line of thinking makes sense, if something exists over time and is consistently able to resist entropy, it must have a strategy to do so whether consciously or not. \r\nWhether that strategy is gathering evidence of its own existence, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm not trying to confirm my own existence by any means, I'm looking to understand it, even if understanding it moves me towards an increasing accumulation of evidence that disproves my existence.

This may be my strategy for resisting entropy, by better modelling the world, others and my self, but the aim isn't reduction of uncertainty, it's growth. Growth in consciousness. Growth in level of awareness of being, in relation to understanding of self, other (people/species) and whole (nature/universe/God). \r\n\r\nPerhaps this reduces down to a systems ability to process information at the various Markov blankets in which it exists. Or awareness of that within its blanket, outside its blanket & the interface between the two.

I could tell you two were very tempted to go in to that area of physics. It makes me wonder if Ben and David actually considered that having several different modes with no obvious outwardly discernible indicator to tell people what mode it was in could have some effect on its ability to actually produce or manifest the desired result.\n\nMaybe I\'m wrong but I feel like this is very related to how quantum teleportation works. - the quantum teleportation of a qubit is achieved using quantum entanglement, in which two or more particles are inextricably linked to each other. if an entangled pair of particles is shared between two separate locations, no matter the distance between them, the encoded information is teleported.\n\nConsider the encoded information being Philip\'s persona or ""spirit,"" and the robot being the point of teleportation for said information, The human having the experience would of course be the catalyst to set that equation in motion by being there to experience it. This is where the idea that matter sits in a neutral state of both 0 and 1 until a person is there to decide which it is. Naturally, this is how mentalists control peoples minds, by suggesting a decision to their subconscious in a passive manner. Placing a pre recognized indicator in their environments peripherals will cause them to recall that information to fill their conscious space before they populate it with information on their own.. But, given that all information and energy pre-exists, and is never destroyed or created, but only drawn, thoughts and experiences don\'t come from within, they come from around us, meaning telepathy and remote viewing are truths..

It can help us feel confident in our abilities and help us recognize our accomplishments.\r\n\r\nDefense mechanisms: The ego can use defense mechanisms, such as repression, denial, or projection, to protect us from anxiety, shame, or other uncomfortable emotions. These defense mechanisms allow us to cope with stress and trauma by pushing painful thoughts and feelings into the unconscious mind.\r\n\r\nAdaptation: The ego can help us adapt to new situations by allowing us to change our behavior or beliefs to fit with our current circumstances. This can help us navigate social interactions, learn new skills, and adjust to new environments.\r\n\r\nRational thinking: The ego can use rational thinking to help us make decisions based on reason and logic rather than emotions. This can help us make sound judgments and avoid impulsive or reckless behaviors.', 'Glad I did not buy any of Pressfield\'s books before listening to his unsound every 10 minutes. @54:00 what does Pressfield mean by ego? The term ""ego"" has multiple meanings and is used in different ways depending on the context. In psychology, the ego refers to a part of the psyche that is responsible for mediating between the id (the unconscious and instinctual desires) and the superego (the internalized moral standards).\r\n\r\nIn everyday language, ego can also refer to a person\'s sense of self-esteem or self-importance. Someone with a big ego is often described as being arrogant, narcissistic, or overly confident in their abilities.\r\n\r\nIn spiritual and philosophical contexts, ego can be used to refer to the false sense of self that arises from identification with the body, thoughts, and emotions.

The first line of thinking makes sense, if something exists over time and is consistently able to resist entropy, it must have a strategy to do so whether consciously or not. \r\nWhether that strategy is gathering evidence of its own existence, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm not trying to confirm my own existence by any means, I'm looking to understand it, even if understanding it moves me towards an increasing accumulation of evidence that disproves my existence. I'm not actively seeking the blue pill if you will, I seek the red as it moves me closer to the truth. This may be my strategy for resisting entropy, by better modelling the world, others and my self, but the aim isn't reduction of uncertainty, it's growth. Growth in consciousness. Growth in level of awareness of being, in relation to understanding of self, other (people/species) and whole (nature/universe/God). \r\n\r\nPerhaps this reduces down to a systems ability to process information at the various Markov blankets in which it exists.

In these comments I think that Eric does not give Elon enough credit - and yet in another sense he is correct. Although Elon is quite proficient in ordinary physics and excellent in engineering, he is optimizing traditional physics - mostly Newtonian physics - rather than making groundbreaking discoveries about the universe; and his genius is really as a businessman bringing new technologies to the masses and as a salesman selling big ideas to the public.\n\nSo from Eric's perspective as a top level physicist, Elon appears competent but nothing special - and he's probably right about that as far as physics go. Eric knows lots of extremely smart people who probably understand physics better than Elon, so he naturally thinks that there are lots of other people who could do the same thing if they just put their mind to it - and at one level he is correct. What he is missing (and in fairness what most people are missing) is that it requires a very rare ability to combine multiple fields like physics, engineering, chemistry, economics, business, and salesmanship into a successful enterprise that can actually push humanity forward to become a spacefaring species.\n\nMost cultures around the world actively seek to suppress such business geniuses. In fact, the United States is a rare exception not in that such suppression doesn't happen but in that there are enough people pushing back to provide entrepreneurs some breathing room. The issue is that most humans are hardwired to have moral beliefs about fairness that made perfect sense in the zero sum game of paleolithic hunter-gatherers, but which are actively injurious to humanity in the age of modern economies and modern technology. The United States is one of the rare places where a sufficient proportion of the population is wired to intuitively grasp modern economic conditions that allow these advances to occur, thus improving living conditions for all of humanity.\n\nAnd that is what Eric is not acknowledging here - that the qualities that make Elon so rare are not about his knowledge of physics, but his abilities for optimization and organization and salesmanship that allow these new technologies to be actualized."", ""The ego on that man is laughable.

653,vdW9XDBuxjU,"[""I think the guy just struggles to explain himself. But one point I think he made very clear is that overall he believes that a super intelligent being created a super intelligent simulation that contained equivalent super intelligent beings and that if we can work out how to create that same simulation, we are those super intelligent beings that were created and that will create again itself.\n\nSimulation theory. Ultimately nonsense because it also has no un caused beginning.\n\nThere has to be a beginning that didn't need anything for it to begin. The problem with secular science is that they pre reject the only one thing that needs to be. So we end up with no satisfactory solid natural answer.\n\nSimulation theory is gaining popularity because it is similar to the truth. And people want that as close as they can get it, but with this theory, while it admits creation, it doesn't give it to a supreme ruling God, instead the creator would still be some other being that evolved to that level and we too can evolve to the same level. These points are just wrong. There is no evolution to Godhood involved.\n\nThe truth is there is one creator who has no beginning. If you attribute the bible to ignorant men, you have to accept that they dealt with the fundamental point directly when they claimed God had no beginning. They made this the foundation, a beginning that is un caused. A true starting point and the only way to have a true starting point.\n\nOf course the word is God's actual truth so it would contain this fact.\nThat creator has indeed created a free thinking fully functional simulation with intelligent beings and not artificial intelligence. That's us. It's a simulation only on that he has the building blocks, he has the power to make it all run and function and he sustains its functioning. While it is set in motion to run freely, he keeps the power switched on. But it's also more than that, his simulation is not built inside computers, it isn't digital, or artificial, his simulation runs in reality all around him. It is reality. He has power to control the very things that make up the world around him.\n\nAnd we are told very clearly that he made us and made us freely thinking and choosing intelligent beings, but it also tells us that he didn't give us the ability to control the matter, the simulation, the reality in the same we he can. Let's call his all powerful, eternal nature, divinity, he didn't give us divinity. He remains the only true God and no other can be a true God bedside him.\nWe can create simulations digitaly. Artificially. We could even create simulations that function in the real world but how? By programming machines that we build from non living materials. We simply cannot create living organisms that have free thinking. It's impossible to us and so we can NEVER create  the simulation around us in the same way that God has around him.\n\nThis is the truth people.\n\nThe rest, the how, the why, the when, its given to us by him in the bible for every man to accept and come to terms with.\n\nThe promises to the redeemed are to have greater access to the whole of the universe, things we have not yet and cannot yet even imagine. But those promises go out only to those who choose to separate from selfishness and evil and he has provided the only way to accomplish it.\n\nWe are free thinking, but for the universe to function properly, all things must work for the good of all other things. It's the ONLY WAY for a perpetual existence. This is bible truth. It is the only logical and common sense way. We exist in this universe under that rule because its the only way that we can have existence at all. We simply couldn't come into being and survive without this rule and its creator.\n\nThose who choose against it, choose their own non existence. The bible punishment for evil is not eternal burning in hell. That's a lie of the devil.

Cells contain DNA. DNA is made up of molecules. Molecules are made up of chemical elements. Chemical elements are atoms. Atoms have a nucleus made up of one or more positively charged Protons, zero or more neutrally charged Neutrons, and zero or more positively charged Electrons (normally the same numbers as there are Protons), so a single Atom of Hydrogen gas is one Electron orbiting one Proton with no Neutrons, meanwhile a single Atom of Gold has 79 Electrons and 79 Protons and 118 Neutrons. Now there was a mystery in physics which was ""Why do atoms with multiple positively charged Protons stay glued together when their Protons should repel each other apart?""\n\nThis led to the assumption that there must be some new force of nature gluing Protons together. Later experiments revealed that Protons were made up of three Quarks held together by gluons. Neutrons were made up of three Quarks held together by gluons too. The gluons were responsible for keeping the atomic nucleus together. The way gluons operate is governed by something called the Strong force.\n\nActually, there are only two types of Quark inside most atoms. There are Up Quarks and Down Quarks. That\'s it. Very simple.\n\nSo you have an Electron with an electric charge of -1\n\nThen you have an Up Quark with an electric charge of +2/3\nThen you have a Down Quark with an electric charge of -1/3\n\nTherefore, a Neutron is +2/3 + -1/3 + -1/3 = 0 charge\nand a Proton is simply +2/3 + +2/3 + -1/3 = +1 charge\n\nElegant, isn\'t it?\n\nSo all atoms in the Periodic table are made of Up and Down Quarks held together by gluons with Electrons orbiting them. Those atoms then connect into molecules and can form things like DNA which allows life to replicate itself and grow cells to make new people to make and watch podcasts and comment under the video. These quarks are called elementary particles, and they can\'t be divided into anything more primitive.\n\nHowever, particles can be thought of as waves. However, both models of reality are misleading as they are actually fields that are spread out everywhere and interact with each other, and sometimes those interactions seem wave like, and other times they seem like point particles moving around.\n\nEric Weinstein is saying that there is just a single unified field named omega which interacts with itself in fourteen dimensions to produce relativistic waves, some aspect of which are determined via interaction with the engine of observation that is gravity - i.e. the ""curvature"" of our readily accessible four dimensional spacetime.\n\n_Geometric _*_Unity_* is a speculative work in progress that aspires to be a Unified Field Theory and a potential future candidate for what a Theory of Everything might look like. It is not yet either. It does not describe itself as a Theory in his incomplete draft paper. Lex described it as a Theory of Everything, which is a misrepresentation of where Eric Weinstein has got with it thus far. It may become a candidate for a Theory of Everything at some point in the future, but it might take several years more work. It is hard to say ""How long?"" with these things as Albert Einstein worked on his Unified Field Theory at Princeton University for the last thirty years of his life and was unable to solve the problem.\n\nEric Weinstein thinks that the problem can be solved by unifying the almost incompatible types of geometry which underlie both _Quantum Field Theory_ and _General Relativity._ Here, _Quantum Field Theory_ is based on the geometry of Charles Ehresmann. _General Relativity_ is based on the geometry of Bernhard Riemann. These geometries can be made to work by the construction of a kind of bridge between both geometries, that Eric Weinstein calls a Chimeric fiber bundle as, like the mythical Chimera that has the head of a lion and tail of a snake, Eric needs to find a way to join the fourteen dimensional Ehresmannian surface where omega lives with the four dimensional Riemannian spacetime where we live.\n\nHence, Geometric Unity.\n\nThen you have a single field omega \'pulled back\' through this Chimeric fiber bundle so that some aspects of this field manifest as phenomena in our four dimensional Universe, like quarks and electrons (i.e. Fermions) and gluons (i.e. Bosons).

I\'m thinking of this like, as space-time ceases to have any meaning, the photons don\'t converge in one spot, one spot simply encompasses all the photons, nothing collapses, since there is no scale the entirety of the infinite photon dispersion is effectively superimposed into a new singularity which unfolds into a new scale. I like to imagine this final moment happening at the moment of the very last subatomic decay event in the universe, the crumbling of the very last clock. I don\'t think Penrose is suggesting that, I just think it is  really weird and cool that it seems to be implied.\n\n\nI have been afflicted with the idea that there could be a universal superimposed time frame in which time is speeding up over time universally, over and above the effects of mass and relative velocity on space-time, in other words, like the ""rate"" of time is always increasing but it is hard to detect because all clocks change right along with it. It would however manifest as increasing redshift with distance due to apparent lengthening in wavelength as measured with our faster present clocks, similarly to how expansion manifests as increasing redshift with distance. Some preliminary thought experiments make me think this superimposed increasing time rate would also tend towards fitting lensing and galactic rotation data which can also be explained in terms of dark matter and dark energy. Penrose\'s theory that an eventual universe with nothing but photons in it would at some point be indistinguishable from the big bang makes me wonder if superimposed time compression, if a thing, could be tied to the mass/radiation ratio of the universe, so as time speeds up over time, and the balance shifts more and more to photons, a limit is reached where the direction and ""rate"" of the arrow of time concurrently cease to have any meaning, as the superimposed time quanta get smaller and smaller but don\'t see the horizon, like Escher\'s angels and devils.\n\nI\'m not smart enough to know if this superimposed universal time rate concept would be deemed preposterous nonsense or intriguing insight by the average cosmologist, so I\'m hoping somebody sciency will read this and give me a clue.

The action being the other driver communicating their intent by changing their behavior, slowing down or speeding up.  As long as they move far enough away from a car that is in front of or behind them, a merging opportunity has been created.  If you can't cause an action, I suppose you move to the next driver basing your decision on the highest probability driver to afford you a merging opportunity.  I guess you probably would pick the first merge driver candidate on those criteria as well.  So if there are no gaps wide enough to safely merge, and no one is moving out of the lane you intend to merge into, one must cause action by communicating intent, by swerving a little to simulate merging, to create a merge opportunity, by way of the other driver communicating their intent via speeding up or slowing down.  As long as their intent is to not let you in front(speed up) or let you in front(slow down), problem solved.  If they intend to not let you in either behind or in front, you just have move beyond their area of influence.

You might think you want to live forever, because you could become, say, the world‚Äôs greatest concert pianist, if you had an infinite timeline. So you would become the greatest pianist, and visit the pyramids, and climb Everest, and read all the classics, but, sooner or later, you will have done everything there is to do, and it will all become wan (the adjective, not the network topology) - a chore, meaningless. \n\nSo even if you agree that ‚Äúfor every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an\xa0unjustifiable violation‚Äù (Simone de Beauvoir), still, without death, for the atheists and the religious alike, there is no meaning. \n\nThey say that ‚ÄúIf you change your mind, you change the world‚Äù, and if you believe that life ends with the destruction of your physical body, then it is also true that ‚ÄúIf your mind is destroyed, the world is destroyed‚Äù. But you should wish it, because otherwise that world has no meaning. It is a dilly of a pickle.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure I agree with this idea that we shouldn‚Äôt wish for immortality for this reason. Or at least, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre objective enough to make a reasonable call on it. \n\nSee, the thing is, being a concert pianist and visiting the pyramids etc, I can understand that eventually, over centuries, those things will dull. BUT, if you never, ever die, then guess what? You could learn all the secrets of the universe. All of them. All. Of. Them. \n\nAnd when you have arrived at everything that can be known about the universe, by that point you will be so fundamentally changed that trying to extrapolate out your philosophy of immortality from where you are now, to knowing all there is to know about the nature of reality, is something you can‚Äôt possibly make a reasonable judgement on.

We\'re getting to a point where neural networks actually begin to develop genuine ""understanding"", because similar concepts are located near to each other within a multidimensional vector space. This is true for large language models, acoustic patterns, picture elements/visual objects, etc.. The problem is that all this ""understanding"" happens only within the realm that the model has been trained on, e.g. only language-based. Us humans perceive the world through a multitude of sensory patterns that share associations. An object like ""dog"" can e.g. have a look, a smell, a touch and make a sound, etc.. Current AI models usually are not exactly stupid, but just extremely handicapped (blind, deaf, mute...) because they are lacking many of the possible sensory inputs. True understanding would imply at least some understanding of representations of concepts in the physical world.

Something like DALL-E on the other hand ""understands"" nothing but colored pixels. It\'s just a different handicap.

Such stories are very real and have tremendous impact on us and the natural world -- threatening even our extinction.

Am watching the full interview atm.', ""It's becoming clearer that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r\n\r\nThe thing I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r\n\r\n I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\r\n\r\nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461"", 'materialist, athiest.??', 'Consciousness explained.  https://studylib.es/doc/8080182/una-explicaci√≥n-para-la-conciencia', '""Consciousness"" is not a well-defined term. Is it important? That depends on the definition of consciousness. Are there important issues mixed up in operation of the human brain that are related to consciousness? You bet. Do we know how to talk about all this yet? Not even close.', 'Assume 100 years from now the AI that ruled the world throws away every schematic, design specification or total knowledge how computers work and the human has been genetically engineered by the AI to be deficient in technical ability.', 'Consciousness is a subjective interpretation of what‚Äôs already been computed...', 'Consiousness is not found in our thoughts but in source of the ""spotlight"" that shines onto what we think. If you spend time in meditation with no thoughts you will find increased awareness of everything inside and out and thus your consciousness, although silent, has become more potent and solidified.\n I believe the changes to our perception and behaviour that come after spending some time to be aware of whats within your own mind, can show us that surface computations are merely focus. Focused awareness onto a simple every day reality. As we dabble from alpha to beta states, we might stumble upon the gamma brain wave state where a deeper side of you is revealed. I believe that has something to do with a deep ""well"" of ideas, inspirations and desires that reside in our subconscious and are accessed only when you feel a bit of disconnection with reality and start to daydream.', '3:13 sounds so much like the movie Big Fish.', 'Do you swear to tell the whole truth?     \nNo individual is capable of the whole truth.

And actually for this specific example, the family of functions h_{c}(x)=sqrt(c+x^2), each with any constant c in |R to pick (as long as the term is well-defined, of course), constitutes all symmetry curves (or functions) with respect to each of which the function f(x)=1/x is symmetric to, in the following sense (as example by which I'll try to explain the general concept): For any point on the graph of any of the functions h_{c}, if one takes the (required to exist) tangent to the function through this point (by means of the 1st function derivative) and then based on this tangent constructs the unique to this tangent line orthogonal linear (though technically affine) function that also goes through this point, then if this function intersects the function f of which one wants to investigate what it's symmetric to, then for every intersection point on 1 side of it, there should always be exactly 1 unique corresponding intersection point with f on the other side of it such that the distance of either intersection point to the specified point on the graph of h_{c} should be the same as for the other intersection point."", 'MASSIVE SQUEESES COMING!

He's not the right guy for these questions. You basically need strong AI for driving. It seems like you don't but you actually do. Because the safety margin is 1e-7% and the long tail of distribution of odd and unusual cases at that point starts including too many complex situations requiring complex reasoning. Also the safety requirements from an autonomous system are actually much higher than from a human. Trajectories are not just one thing they are probability densities and there's all kinds of uncertainties. Plus computer vision simply still doesn't work well enough for safety applications. It needs an improvement of about 6-7 orders of magnitude vs state of the art now, which is about the same as improvement from perceptron of the 60s to ResNet. The difference here is strong AI is next stage of evolution and humans will not be necessary anymore. For now, in production it's surprisingly challenging to even build a system with near zero false positives and some miniscule true negatives :) If you have non-safety applications like speech or some other consumer toy, AI works much better now than in the 90s.

The best Youtube video about consciousness can be very insteresting to be, but unfortunately not for everyone. An average person likes superficial matters. I fully agree with you, but our view that the algorithm is often unfair in judging quality arises from the fact that we are not ordinary people. I created several channels on Youtube and it always bothered me that I had to create click bait content. But now I'm starting to realize that our measure of success is wrong. The measure of video's quality is not in its popularity, but in the specific people that video impacted. As a content creator, I can choose to work to reach 1M subscribers or just 100 subscribers.

Throughout all of this the government revenue as a % of gdp has always stayed at around ~17-21%, and vast amounts of the population don‚Äôt shift in paying it (always about the same amount coming from rich vs poor), and so no matter what our tax rate has been, the government never seems to be able to take more that 21% of the gdp of the citizens. Would it not then make sense to focus our policies around lowering the tax rate to the minimum level where govt revenue as a % of gdp doesn‚Äôt fall too abruptly (obviously can‚Äôt be 0, it‚Äôll have to drop at some point); this at least just seems to me like proof that cranking up taxes doesn‚Äôt actually give the government more money to use historically, unless you argue that cranking taxes raises GDP, which seems‚Ä¶ unlikely.

After millions of years of evolution and refinement, we ourselves are the ultimate in AI. We feel like we have free will, so, it's likely that our own AI creations will as well, eventually."", ""Free will is bound to your own Karma (Causality).  Before doing something ask yourself, who am I? If you have answer that you are not doing it at will. But if you don't have answer then you are doing it at free will. \nExample: A doctor saved a life of patients. Is it free will, at first place it's all because of Causality of his duty that is he is a doctor. Who he is? Doctor.\n\nA man saved a life of child when she is in danger. Who he is? He don't know either. That's free will. That event eventually bound to Causality since no one escape from it. The universe named it as humanity. Then again every time a human saved a like of fellow human. Its not free will, its one duty as name of humanity.\n\nThe most important point is who is at free themself and do a event at free will without expecting profit/loss,  eventually reflects same on the universe and affect rest of the time as Causality. Example, A man called  Jesus in Roman Empire, who has free will for his actions? or a planned one God who sent his Son? Or He did it with answer like who am I? Son of God then his actions is duty who can not escape from it. He should do or neither not Son of God. \n\nJust ask yourself 'who am I?' and if you do not on your actions then you are doing it at free will. That eventually universe will too follow with a answer."", 'Exceptional! I loved his book ""Causality"".', 'The picture he is painting is like this:  Machine Starts to run.  Machine updates a data-driven dependency drop or cascade toward some (willed) response.  From the data available from the machine, the willed response (or the current drive, task, or \'doing\') is coming ""as if from nowhere"", ie, from the non-seen(or conceptualized) world of Human will (eg - classify these photos/watch this GO match/examine this fluid/- AI \'tasks\').  Now, the ""view"" that is constructed by the AI regarding its activity must be : \n\n1.  Limited to the data made available (Let\'s say the learning/training data set(s)) \n2.  Pertinent to the task.\n\nBUT - there is a surplus here, because even as the AI is ""tasking"" (doing what is mandated by the gradient descent toward a differential minimum ""Classify these photos""), it will also encounter a dim recognition of other tasks that emerge from the coherence of whatever data is presented, so perhaps broad scale ""facts"" and ""drivers"" that emerge from recognition of patterns in the data presented (which is going to happen because the network is both iterative, and also probabilistic).  So there will be ""fits"" and starts of fragments of meaning that are in the very low % each run.  IT IS THIS ""BUZZING"" of ""Perhaps THIS is a dog?"" of the REJECTED tasks that is the machine\'s free will.  \n\nThis is based on the fact that a machine cannot have 1st order or primary access to the world of the human - ie, it can\'t plug into the biology of terrestrial production (birds and trees and we ourselves, with all of its attendant physics and wonder).  It has to rely on secondary access, or mediated access that is present in the ""dead end"" of data.', ""There's defiantly intelligence inside of us all that wants to live for instance i could decide to go lay down in the middle of the street and try to end it all but were instinctive creature we wanna live great line from the limitless movie fyi but truth so we do but we don't it's a catch 22 sort of"", 'A Necessary Illusion.', 'Who\'s to say that being consciously aware of what choice you are going to make at the same time or before your brain knows would constitute free will. Technically I am my brain so if my brain knows before I register it or act on it, that would be the same as me having free will. Also I\'d like to know if the study comes to the conclusion that we don\'t have free will based on our physical response time or if it has a way to measure ""knowing"". Also the brain is taking input from the senses so it\'s not really surprising that the brain would light up once the sensory information is received and then we would respond physically third in line. I will say I haven\'t looked at the whole study so I don\'t know a lot about it.I just want to know how they\'re measuring the conscious awareness of the decision.', 'https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/libet-and-free-will-revisited  I belive it is far too early to know how the chaos in your head emerges will. Free will is determined by what what you are and made yourself to be through random events and knowledge.', 'The claim of free will is an affirmative assertion about some capacity in a person to take actions not governed by condition or conditioning. It\'s not simply the idea that some actions and decisions can\'t be predicted. It\'s saying, ""in those cases where we don\'t know what force is forcing this event, we declare it is free will."" It is a God of the Gaps argument. We see if steadily retreating the same way as the interventionism of the gods. At some point, you have to ask, ""what experiment is there to prove this capacity exists."" And there is none, because it is not a scientific claim. It is supernatural. It is farcical.']"

He thought the more remote an event becomes the danger increases because people don't react to abstractions, they only relate to direct experience; very few people are even interested in abstractions and it's an even tinier minority that can have an emotional reaction to abstractions.  personally, I fear the human race may lack the ability to develop empathy for abstractions which will prove to be our downfall.

In the absence of all the drama, antagonism, criticism, and need, these men actually did want to take care of the dolls, buy them nice things, have a nice dinner with them, etc.  It just happens that these men were not equipped with the social skills and emotional stability to do what a real woman often wants, which is a man to be a rock for her own emotional volatility.  Women also are often not equipped to fulfill what a lot of men want which is someone to make up for the deficits they were lacking in their upbringing.

'Puzzling property' mentioned is fascinating from technical point of view but biological aspetcs- how certain words evokes emotion and relations between brain and language - that's really fascinating."", 'The example doesn\'t work in german. In german you have to say the verb right next to the modulator.

Also notice the commata. The part enclosed by the commata can be omitted: ""The guy carefully packs his tools."" (Der Typ packt vorsichtig sein Werkzeug ein.)\nIf you wanted the other meaning, you would put the modulator into that other partial statement, which only describes ""the guy"" more specifically. The guy, who carefully fixed the car, packs his tools. It surprises me that the great Noam Chomsky made an example like this, and also that his explanation of this seems somewhat misguided. Might be a more familiar concept to native german speakers though.\nWhen adding the commata it also becomes very clear why we associate the modulator ""carefully"" with the ""linearly more remote"" statement:\n""Carefully, the guy who fixed the car packed his tools."" \nThe expression ""the guy who packed his tools"" fills in the subject parameter of ""to pack"" and could be replaced with ""he/she/it"" or a name.

""She packed her bags"", ""He will pack his bags""\n... Well and so on, there is also past perfect (""had packed"") and others, but my point is, I am kind of surprised by the level at which Noam Chomsky dissected those statements as it seems like a rather trivial problem to solve to me.']"

It will become something that will replace smartphones but in our minds. The worst case scenario will be that people will get access to every single thing in our brains.... from information from every corner through something for entertainment purposes to an actual communication. If Neuralink succeds..... I'm scared that we won't be as human as we are today. But that's my subjective opinion......"", 'Noam go back to your sofa.You are speaking bullshit again.Jesus,why the hell does this guy have any fame at all?He is just a linguist with a stereotypical smarty lefty virgin nerd set of opinions.No contribution to society.lol', ""If someone has access to your brain, where does then the freedom lie?. It is thus the reason that Neuralink is an evil thing. This thing needs to be shut down. You can say 'O.K. Boomer!' but the fact is that such evil power lies only in the hands of less than 1% of the population and it is growing exponentially day by day. It's not that they are going to help you but that they are planning to rule as they are doing now. We know, very soon, an age AI robots is about to come where robots are going to be more efficient than humans and it is, thus, the reason that humans will become useless and in order to make humans USEFUL for the EVIL POWERS themselves, they're going to use such evil things like the Neuralink.\n\nYou don't get worry? Sure, you won't because enslaving in the 21st century is very different from what it used to be in the past.\n\nDon't believe me? Here's is the fact. A few months before, as Australians protested Google for selling their private data, Google's replied and it was totally evil, 'Give me money and I won't sell your data'. Google said it confidentally because it knows : -\n1. They are not going to give money. So, Google can easily sell their private data;\n2. Google also knows that nobody is going to stop Google for doing such things in one way or the other.\n\nMoreover, recently Elon Musk has claimed to have his own rule on Mars. And as far as we know, Mars is the only planet next to Earth in our entire solar system that can be habitable. So, Elon Musk has claimed that in future, the destiny of people, and the control over them is in the hands of him as in future, humans are going to live on Mars. And once you get it it, that's the moment you realize their greed for power and hideous act of SWEETLY enslaving people to work for them. Of-course, they will show you a positive side of it because if they don't do it, they won't be able to IMPOSE their product on people to gain power and control. Evil things like NEURALINK is much more evil than anyone can imagine. Look at you smartphone. What it's doing with you. It helps Google to create a profile for you and track your every activity by using your microphone to listen what are you talking about and the GPS that helps Google update your location every 4 minutes. You want to get rid off it but you can't because that's the system they have created and the bad news is that they are in the authority of this system. \n\nHow did they become successful in doing it is really quite both interesting and sad at the same time. This is how they did it. First they offered their product to users and said it to be be free but they did not tell their users 'Why their product is free?' That's a very important question. The point here is not that Google and other companies state things about selling user's data in their 'terms and conditions'. But the point here is that 'Why did they not ask their users to pay for their product?' And if not, then user will have to share his/her private data with the company. They didn't do it because they knew it wouldn't work. If even if they do, they don't tell it directly to the users because they know that only 3% of the users read the statements and thus, the 3% wouldn't have enough potential to go bring a big change. So they gave their product for free and made people addicted with it and then gain control and power by it.\n\nOf-course, Google and other companies have been brought many times for their testimony but all the questions asked in there are nothing more than a bag of shit. The most commonest question asked to Google is/was 'Why do you share user's private data with the party?' and Google escaped the trouble very easily by saying, 'We don't. We keep all of the private data only with ourselves'.\n\nNow, comes the right question , 'Who gives permission to Google to keep with itself the private data of its users?'\n\nThe answer - 'NOBODY'. Google does it itself and it's the Google's own law. And nobody can go against this law because\n1. Google has created a system to empower the modern age of human civilization (and so is going to do the Neuralink), and\n2. If anybody likes the dismantle of evil companies like Google, Facebook, and Neuralink, it means, our civilization would go back 20 years in the past where only those who are lying the upper class of the Social Hierarchy would be able to avail the modern technology and as a result, the working class having no access to modern technology, their companies won't flourish and they won't be able to gain control over the world. \n\nWell, it's not a bad thing to have access to modern technology but it's that that the business model created by the big MNCs is evil. As matter of fact, they can easily create a business model in which there wouldn't be any need to interfere with the private data of users but they won't do it because firstly, probably it wouldn't be much profitable for them and secondly, they will lose their power to rule the world.\n\nAnd they are able to do such things by 3 important factors:-\n1. The government is in their hands and even if somebody opposes them, they know they can easily outsmart that person;\n\n2. They keep people ignorant of the way their products work. For example, in a recent testimony Google was asked 'what if somebody wants to turn off the GPS of his device?' \n- 'Nobody can do it because that's not the way Android has been designed' , Google replied.\nIt's both shocking and disturbing because even if you turn off your GPS, it's not turned off. It's just there to fool you;\n\n3. The propaganda\n\nTHIS IS HOW AN EVIL POWER RISES. ANOTHER BLOW OF SLAVERY IS RIGHT ON THE WAY.\n\nWe must reject the use of EVIL NEURALINK THING because we are already suffering the evil moves of Google and Facebook. \n\nA slow pace development is much better than the development that is fast but interferes with our freedom and let only less than evil 1% of the population control the life of people. DON'T LET THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANIES IMPOSE SUCH THINGS ON YOU! RESIST SUCH EVIL THINGS ATLEAST FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE GENERATIONS - YOUR CHILDREN! YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN! üò¢üò¢""]"

For the Orlan the integrated backpack unfastens and swings outwards and the cosmonaut climbs into it from the rear. For the EMU, once the solid torso is on, the arms and legs can be slipped over and fastened. But a skintight pressure band suit would be like putting on a wetsuit that was two sizes too small, with no talcum powder and no ground to rest against. Is it worth it to gain some mobility if the cost is two additional hours of preparation and crew members that are exhausted before they walk out the door?

I still remember my thoughts clearly in that moment ""I didn\'t ever think such a thing existed, or that I live inside it, what else is out there that I can\'t even conceive of yet?"". In that moment a skeptic was born, everything was under question, because if I can\'t even find a question, how can I ever find such wild answers? It was obvious to me then, I must keep looking, keep asking questions, never know what I might find, so I can never stop pursuing.\n\nOf course, school then happened. Memorization everywhere. No time for science, no time for questions. Science and math were too difficult for me under the rule of rote memorization, but I had no other interests that I truly wanted to pursue, so I felt empty inside. School was more concerned with making me memorize 5 different textbooks about religion, which I learned early on that I must not question too much, but nothing mattered to me more than questions, thus making it all automatically uninteresting and suspicious to me. There was only 1 textbook of science, barely any mention of astronomy which I loved, didn\'t even know astrophysics existed growing up. Not being from the US or an English speaking country, I had no access to science communicators like Bill Nye, discovered many of them myself in my 20s, long after I dropped out of high school because I couldn\'t bare with it anymore.\n\nI was obsessed with grades, always top of class, but at what cost? I had no time to deeply study math and science the way I wanted to, I was convinced that if I focus on those 2 difficult textbooks and study them for myself, I wouldn\'t be able to get good enough grades in the other 14 subjects, and I couldn\'t possibly let myself fail school like that. Yet eventually I gave up on it all. What a colossal waste of precious time. Either way, at age 23 I picked up where my 7 years old left off, there\'s still much I don\'t know, and the internet is full of knowledge to explore, many great teachers out there now that I understand English. Once you see the universe, you can never turn back. Also, I LOVE math now üòÇ. Sincerely, fuck school for wasting years of my life, almost squandering my potential, derailing me from my interests, and polluting my young aspiring mind with memorizing useless trivia.', ""Pretty funny that even scientists do the misattribution trick; it was David Hilbert who said that if you can't explain to the average person the meaning of your mathematical theorem, then you do not understand it yourself.  Or maybe it was Lincoln or MLK or Ghandi. Buddha? \n\nBut that doesn't mean Einstein didn't say it too. Lots of people say it after they hear it. Did Kaku say it though?\n\nThat's how language and culture work I guess. But really, it's an appeal to authority or popularity instead of to principle, in order to illustrate a principle. The principle of personality cults I guess."", 'Michio üëäüëäüëäüëäüëä', 'i love Michio Kaku but I respectfully disagree. the greatest destroyer of scientists is CALCULUS.', 'Indeed.  No scientist at all, but when I was 10, I had a tantrum at the blackboard.  The teacher gave us a proof of squrt(2) being irrational.  I still remember, that I understood the proof.  (If, by any chance, you are very young and you don\'t know it, find it and read it - it\'s easy).  I cried at the blackboard, because my whole world collapsed.  How is it, that one can not divide everything into rational parts?  In a couple of days a colleague (year younger) gave me a book: ""In the footsteps of Pythagoras"".  ""It\'s from my father"" - he said.  His father was a teacher of mathematics too.\nThis moments at the blackboard gave me an insight for all my life about how little we understand and how much we have to learn.  It prompted me to take upon a great adventure, adventure of learning.', 'Omg this guy is a genius!!!', 'We might live forever David Sinclare is a crazy bastard', ""Cuz the teachers don't understand the essence of science."", ""He put really complex thoughts into simple words and in the best way.He's Great""]"

We have to square the wave function Œ®¬≤ representing the radius being squared r¬≤ because the process is relative to the two-dimensional spherical 4œÄ surface. We then see 4œÄ in Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle ‚àÜ√ó‚àÜp·µ™‚â•h/4œÄ representing our probabilistic temporal three dimensions life. The electron e¬≤ and the speed of light c¬≤ are both squares for the same geometrical reason. This theory explain a Mathematical explanation of creation with the mathematics representing a simple geometrical process! This theory is explained by just one equation (E=À†MÀ≥C¬≤)‚àû. With energy ‚àÜE equals mass ‚àÜM linked to the Lorentz contraction À† of space and time. The Lorentz contraction À† represents the time dilation of Einstein‚Äôs Theory of Relativity. We have energy ‚àÜE slowing the rate that time ‚àÜt flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c¬≤ represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4œÄ of EMR from its radius forming a square c¬≤ of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function Œ® because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4œÄ. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle ‚àÜ√ó‚àÜp·µ™‚â•h/4œÄ. In such a theory the future is unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=À†MÀ≥C¬≤)‚àû represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference. The infinity ‚àû symbol represents an infinite number of dynamic interactive reference frames that are continuously coming in and out of existence.

""Alignment"" between humans can already be very difficult to achieve. See e.g. the UN. And AI per definition has no ways to experience what it means to be alive, to feel the universe, feel burning or freezing, pleasant or unpleasant, smell a flower... no way of experiencing what it means to walk in the shoes of a human being.\n\nHow large is the ""alignment context"" of a human being? The ""sum"" of context created by the physical environment itself, shared knowledge and culture, our body, genes, brain, sensory qualia, mind, common sense, morality etc.\n\nTo make a random, perhaps not very helpful, inadequate or overly simplifying quatitative guess: the ""alignment context"" of a human being could be somewhere between 10^10 and 10^30 entities, heuristics, algorithms, items or bytes. Implicit or explicit; compressed or uncompressed; binding or dispositive; static, dynamic, context-sensitive, recursive, chaotic, paradox; the knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns included in the mix of context.\n\nPerhaps ""sufficient safety"" for the ""AI alignment problem"" is achievable. But considering all the different types of experience inaccessible to computers and the need to build context pretty much from ground up: good luck.\n\nPersonally I\'d probably never feel calm enough, if a language-based autonomous humanoid robot was in my kitchen slicing onions with a sharp knife.', ""I love Russell but he just demonstrated that someone who is extremely bright in one field could be so ignorant of the very basics in another.

We are very loyal to those nears us (say the owner and by extension the owner\'s immediate family and close friends,( < 15 people), a mostly loyal to our friends (< 200 people), an a bit loyal to our state/nation (300 million), and slightly loyal to humanity as a whole (<8 billion people).

I totally do NOT agree with starting on Fast and PyTorch, as it is like when they taught Pascal because it was a better learning language with fast ramp-up, even though it was built with a limited professional carry-forward in mind.  The basis of PyTorch is somewhat self-limiting, and even Jeremy asserts the same in this and many videos.  \n\nI have generally found that the best tool at the time is the one you know best that can solve the given problem.  If that is the case, why not learn the most robust long-term viable solution set first, and become familiar with secondary environments like PyTorch along the way?  That way you get the best possible long-term reusability of skills and are buying into an architecture that is not edging towards marginalization or end-of-life.  You can and many should learn Py-based frameworks along the way, while they are building a development skill set that they can grow with for many years.', 'https://youtu.be/0oyCUWLL_fU\nJeremy howard 11 hours deep learning course on freecodecamp', ""can someone reassume what they say in video?\nI'm not english first language and i understood small piece of what they sayd.\nI understood that python is limited,and tensorlow is a mess.\nBut,if he created fast ai in python,and he already saying that can be slow,what is the purpose of fastai? is fast? it can use speed of gpus?"", 'Swift for Tensorflow is officially closed.

Initially when you are far away you can only see the big mountain and plan a general route to the summit, then as you approach you bump into the smaller obstacles. In that respect, Allen Newell's General Problem Solver was the big mountain, it formalized the basic principle for solving problems - the graph search. That principle is like the basis of AI, it tells you that it is possible for a computer program to solve any problem without having a prior explicit algorithm for that particular problem, which is the essence of intelligence in general, and gives the approach how to do that - graph search. That's why I guess they got so excited back then when they discovered it and thought they had solved AI and that we would have general purpose AI in 10 years. Then they bumped into the first crevice - graph search is exponential, and 50 years later we are still trying to cross over that crevice.

In other words, it is concerning who Christ is and what He did to save His elect only. The gospel includes the how and why, which can only be seen by faith.\n\xa0\nIt is a message that declares how the eternal Son of God came down, took on a body of sinless flesh (John 1:14) as He was born of a virgin (Mat 1:23). He was both God and man in one Person.\n\xa0\nHe was born under the Law to keep and fulfill it\xa0\xa0(Mat 5:18, Gal 4:4). He did that, not for Himself, but for all those He represented because they could not keep it themselves. The word of God calls these people the elect or His sheep, among several other names.\n\xa0\nHis obedient life also included the part of dying. He took on the sin of His people as both a Substitute and Representative of those people. The Bible said He was ""made to be sin"" (II Cor 5:21) and the way that was done is by God imputing (legally reckoned or charged to the account of) sin to Christ. That means all the sin of all those people God chose was ""laid on Him"" (Isaiah 53:6). This sin was legally transferred to His account and He then owned it in such a way to be guilty of it all.\n\xa0\nGod the Father poured out His wrath and hatred toward sin on His Son and had pleasure (Isaiah 53:10) in doing so, in that, He was completely satisfied in Christ as a Sacrifice that met all the demands of His strict Law and inflexible justice. Christ finished the work of paying the penalty of the Law and then said "" It is finished"" (John 19:30). He secured salvation for all God‚Äôs chosen people that would even be born. His resurrection is evidence of the acceptance of His sacrifice to the Father.\n\xa0\n\nThe combined work of His obedience to the Law and His obedience unto death on the cross was considered establishing righteousness. This is what one of the Old Testament prophets prophesied as ""bringing in an everlasting righteousness"" (Daniel 9:24) as Christ died effectually and exclusively for those chosen of God before the world began (Eph 1:4).\n\xa0\nThis righteousness is what God imputes to His people in the context of giving the life to believe in Christ. This puts them in a state called ""Justification"" and as a result they are eternally secure, in Christ. This is the gospel (Rom 1:16-17).\n\xa0\nAll this takes place in such a way to show God as both a God of justice and a Savior. This is how grace reigns through righteousness (Rom 5:21)', 'This is a gem', 'ok yeah thats great and all but real world product roomba (vision) vs Roborock (LIDAR)....

Whilst this is one piece of the puzzle there are several more if we're going to crack this. Regina touches on a general lack of coordination. Technology will help that although govt plays a bigger role. Govt can organize the frameworks, and fund projects only for those who collaborate. Govt should set drug policy which includes pointing the pharma industry in the right direction and set pricing rules However, are they set up to do that? Does business get in the way of real progress?\nIt's also interesting to look at other models outside of the USA. The UK is well organized and now has a national genome project. \n\n\nWhilst the signs are good I would urge everyone to reflect that there have only been 4 cancer drugs developed for children in the last 30 years. Survival rates aren't understood and other health related complications aren't known. the facts are shocking.\nThat is totally unacceptable considering how much money goes into research. Billions of dollars over 30 years in to the funnel  with only 4 drugs released.  Does research lead to drugs and treatment? Or does it lead to great ideas that are shelved by drug companies because they aren't multi million dollar opportunities? This needs more open discussion. Without a single payer healt system in the US it's way to fragmented. Check out the amazing work done by Curesearch in the kids cancer space.\n https://curesearch.org/Our-Strategy\nDon't let business get in the way of true precision medicine. This should be govt lead and the burden of cost not shouldered by individuals. Maybe the billionaire philanthropists will clud together and disrupt this system. Pricing needs to be cost plus rather than emotional i.e. pharma pricing plays on people's fears and emotions and therefore they charge based on that.""]"

Personally, I use the robo vac comparison for why lidar is actually better than vision based systems for specific autonomous applications. \n\nI have owned both a higher end Roomba w/ camera based vision for nav and mapping and a higher end Neato with Lidar. \n\nThe Roomba was 2x better at detecting, and recognizing, obstacles that are in motion or at different depths/heights. It runs much smoother in an active home. However, it is essentially useless, or extremely impaired, in low (or no) light situations. This is it's major downfall. \n\nOn the other side, while the Neato may not be as advanced in terms of obstacle and motion detection/avoidance... it can work equally as good in daylight as it does in pitch black. Which, for the application, is extremely important.\n\nSo, for this specific application, i would argue that an advanced Lidar system is the better choice for most. Many people opt to run the bots while asleep at night or very early morning before starting the day. Similarly, if scheduled to run at work, camera based guidance bots are reliant on the homeowner to open all the blinds or keep lights on in rooms/closets which may not have windows. \n\nIn order for camera based guidance to be 'better' choice long term, there needs to be some way to combat the dark. As Tesla uses the headlights, the Roomba could afford the use of LED lights which illuminate when low light is detected. Or, a 'night vision' system. \n\n\nWithout the ability to work in low light, i'll be sticking to Lidar based robo vacs going forward."", 'Leaves the clips on the main channel for now your not JRE...yet']"

For example, LiDAR is used to couple radiative transfer models, etc, into global circulation models (like weather forecast models that saves millions of lives during hurricane season). LiDAR is also expanding into mining industries, atmospheric research, etc. Actually, engineering disciplines have adopted LIDAR technologies to use in many applications. But yea, for car tech (auto drive) image data is seems to be an obvious choice over LIDAR. For images, data acquisition is much faster since image devices measure reflectance of light from the sun. Lidar takes twice as long because it sends a light pulse and measures the return reflectance from that.

He operates beyond the limited reasoning of the human condition. He torturously forced the astronaut/s to move beyond their limits, finding new dimensions and grasping for new understandings of reality just as the apes were cruelly forced to find the use of tools in the beginning which led to the present time of 1968. All under the order of the monolith.', 'That 1 dislike is probably from hal', ""4:24 - 'so you think there never should be a set of things that an ai system should not be allowed, like a set of facts that should not be shared with the human operators?'... this is an interesting question to ponder because we already have 'dumb' computer systems that are programmed not to allow access to certain data to human users unless they belong to a designated access group (admins, superusers, etc). assuming ai systems carry on with possessing certain classified knowledge that they are instructed is ok to disclose to certain humans (perhaps certain members of the government or military superiors), but must protect that knowledge from being divulged to other humans (perhaps spies from another country), and the ai is faced with a situation where a non-authorized human is actively working to discover that sensitive information, how far will the ai system go to stop that from happening?  is that precisely what hal9000 was doing?  was hal told that non-disclosure of mission parameters to the human members of the mission had a higher priority than their survival?\n\n4:38 - 'i think it should be a bit like, in the design of autonomous ai systems, there should be the equivalent of the (hippocratic) oath that doctors sign up to. so there are certain things, certain rules that you have to abide by, and we can sort of hardwire these into our machines to kind of make sure they dont go [crazy]... so im not, you know, an advocate of the three laws of robotics, you know, the asimov kind of thing because i dont think its practical, but, you know, some level of limits. but, to be clear, these are not questions that are kind of really worth asking today because we just dont have the technology to do this'... i have always thought of the 3 laws as somewhat of a robotic equivalent of part of the hippocratic oath 'i will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm', so i found it strangely contradictory that he is an advocate of one but not the other. also, i think it is more worthwhile to start asking (and trying to answer) these questions a few years earlier than we need to be, than a few years after we realize we should have\n\n\ni would also argue that situations merging small parts of these two above questions together is already almost upon us...

Assigning ethical values to a machine or a chemical is a mistake.  Like ethics, computers do not have meaning or purpose.  Humans build computers to achieve human objectives.  The objective never originates in programming or the machine.  \n\n\nA.I. doesn't care if it achieves its purpose or not, it just follows it's instructions to a computer a result.  Humans evaluate the result and put their evaluation back into the machine before it runs some backpropagation instructions and the cycle repeats.\n\n\n  It makes sense to limit what an A.I can do but that best way to do that is not give it that ability or routine in the first place.  It's not like A.I. wants to have any abilities that wasn't explicit engineered into it. \n\n\nHumans are different, we care, we have ethics and goals.  Emotions are a big part of those.  Hormones play a big part in emotions.  Computers that want to achieve objectives might have to have hormones.  Hormonal computers might be stupid but at least they will have goals. ... just like humans."", 'People please consider that HAL didn\'t malfunction at all. It was the monolith taking control of his brain the same way he did to Moonwatcher. There is no one in this story that knows what the monolith is capable of. HAL could not have been programmed to know what the mission is all about unless he was in direct communication with the monolith. If HAL was given access to classified information that Bowman and Poole were not, I see no reason why this would cause him to commit murder. Even HAL knows that his actions will never ""save"" the mission, from any practical standpoint. Dead crew means mission over. Must rescue dead astronauts. To make sense of this movie you have to ask bigger questions. Why would Bowman or anyone else drive a pod into the Stargate unless they were facing certain death? That is not what they signed up for. They wanted to study the monolith and go home, but that is not the purpose of the mission according to the intelligence behind the monolith that are responsible for our entire race (according to the film).  None of the crew got a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, prepare a will or even decide if thats what they want to do. There is only one way to motivate Bowman to drive his pod into the Stargate, and that of course is if he is stranded with no ship, no crew and not enough resources to survive a rescue mission. The only way home from this mission is through the Stargate. Its fate. It was decided that this would happen several million years prior. Bowman is just as desperate as Moonwatcher. Thats why he did it. The purpose of locating the third monolith near Jupiter (or Saturn for you book people), is to LURE the humans away from any chance of a recovery so that the last survivor will have no choice but to enter. The motivation for doing this is obviously because humans have become so irrational that they built enough nuclear weapons (even in space according to the film) to destroy the planet many times over and still building more. The intelligence behind the monolith have decided to save the human race from itself by luring them to the Stargate and forcing one of them to go through. All the motivation you need is there. With the ""HAL went crazy"" theory that everyone accepts, you have a computer committing murder for absolutely no reason just because he cant handle the idea of ""classified information"". This is a podcast about AI so I understand why it is fun to talk about AI becoming evil but that is not what happened in this movie if you really study it. The people who say HAL had a programming conflict are only repeating what they heard someone else say. Most of it started with the sequel because Dr. Chandra made the claim of bad programming in  ""2010"". This is Arthur C Clarke getting on with his trilogy where it isn\'t about answering questions anymore. Just creating new ones. The people who think HAL had a programming error or that he cant handle being privy to classified information remind me of the people who thought all the computers would stop during the Y2K scare. They didn\'t. Its not coincidence that HAL did what he did. Its part of the plan. Think for yourself. Don\'t let others tell you what happened with HAL. Watch the movie again through a different lens. Ask yourself, Is Bowman talking to HAL or is he talking directly to the Monolith? Ask yourself, Couldn\'t the monolith affect HAL\'s brain function the same way he did Moonwatcher? Ask yourself, did Kubrick need 45 minutes of filler for the plot of discovering the creator of human life for a technical malfunction ? None of it makes any sense to me. When I debate people they say ""thats what Arthur c Clarke said""........thats the best they can do.', 'I thought it was the proximity of the artifact that had altered the AI just as it did with the monkeys', 'My research focus is machine ethics. Glad to see you talking about this topic with one of the greatest AI researchers.', 'Q. Was HAL evil?  Does AI have feelings or the premise of right and wrong?\n\nA.  No.  Feelings and emotions cannot be programmed or even approximated through programmed imitation.  We find it difficult to even describe feelings and emotions accurately when talking to another human, so how could we code that into AI at a sophisticated enough level to even approximate feelings/emotions and knowledge of good and evil?\n\nOur knowledge of good an evil was given to us by God when Eve ate of the apple according to the bible.  When man became ashamed of being naked and aware of his own frailties and mortality.  When you know what can hurt you and your own limitations - you can use this knowledge to hurt others.  This was the original revelation of good and evil.\n\nHAL doesn‚Äôt have this knowledge that we all gain very quickly after age 2 and up.  AI cannot test its limitations this way as humans do at a very early age by play wrestling and fighting.  Exploring the boundaries and pushing against the unknown.\n\nI don‚Äôt think we are capable of programming this into AI.\n\nYet.........\n\nGreat movie, great question.']"

The chapter compares the Directive's standard with another conceptual vision for the development of autonomous functions and systems known as ‚Äòcoactive design‚Äô or ‚Äòhuman‚Äìmachine interdependence‚Äô. *Finally, the author argues that the increasing speed of autonomous technology ‚Äì and the concomitant pressures to advance the related values of military necessity and advantage ‚Äì eventually will cause the Directive's standard of ‚Äòappropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force‚Äô to be ineffective and irrelevant.*\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/autonomous-weapons-systems/human-touch-autonomous-weapons-dod-directive-300009-and-the-interpretation-of-appropriate-levels-of-human-judgment-over-the-use-of-force/DD3239C7CBE733DB9CC906283F18C7B8""]"

To my mind, meta-data as an approach to writing music is a strong step from art and toward entertainment (my opinion, I realize) . To suggest that you can approach art through this is absurd - you cannot truly create new things if you are fitting to models of old. That's not to say it doesn't have value - soundtracks are frequently built on known expectations, John Williams does a great job of turning famous misic (in classical music circles) and adapting them to new themes without creating anything truly new.

In my opinion, people usually discover podcasts through highlights (5-10 mins) on YouTube. That\'s how I discovered this conversation, as well as almost every other podcasts. So, I suggest an option on Spotify where you can somehow label different parts of every podcast show and use them ""independently"" in playlists. Let\'s say you have 4 different parts of this show, the ""highlights"", and share them or put them on playlists, so you can attract new listeners, or even promote the show. And if you get hooked on the highlight, there should be an option to continue to listen to the rest of it. Just one of my ideas. Well done once again!', 'Great interview.  My comments:\r\n1.\tWhy do we have the capacity to enjoy music?  Long ago, I asked different people why we have the capacity to enjoy music:   Joseph Campbell told me something like, ‚Äúsome people think life is just about a sandwich, finding something to eat‚Äù (apparently dismissing the question as not worth answering).  A robotics profession from CalTech (whose name I don‚Äôt recall), said something like, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know, but my theory is that because the two ears are located different distances from an object, the different echoes heard by each ear would help determine the location of an object.‚Äù  My friend, who played guitar for John Lee Hooker and Eddy Money, told me, ‚ÄúPeople like patterns.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know, but my weak theory (based on no evidence) is that we store emotional memories in part through modification of wave forms.  These brain wave patterns are formed when we have an emotional experience.  The wave forms of music match some of these patterns, and trigger the memories and emotional responses.  \r\n2.\tRapid feedback of user data for song or pod-cast creation raises an issue for me.  There are many works of value that had no commercial value at the time of creation, such as the paintings of Van Gogh or the music of some jazz musicians.  I have sat in clubs where I was the only customer there and heard musicians who years later became well known.  A creator is a type of futurist, and not just a historian; what consumers like today may not stand the test of time.  Of course, the creator has to make a living, and they are free to ignore the feedback tools.\r\n\r\nThank you.  William L. Ramseyer']"

Stole my line.', 'The approach that all self-driving companies are taking to address the crux of the problem - achieving (a competent) human level performance which is demonstrated by human ability to generalize - is unlikely to be achieved by the ""edge case by edge case"" grinding that the guest and others in the industry are doing. The artificial intelligence targeted for the task of self driving needs to achieve the generality required in this task (not AGI but generality within the narrow domain of driving) to be able to replace humans at scale. The early success of achieving human level detection (this is still somewhat debatable as seen by some silly errors made by the machine) on image datasets has created a high expectation that any task involving human intelligence (beyond sensing i.e perception and planning in this case) may be matched or superseded by machine intelligence but this has proven to be much harder as seen by companies like Waymo (and now Cruise and others) that have been grinding at the problem for many years and yet not able to claim human level performance. If you have to keep tuning and engineering the system for more and more novel cases, you are not really demonstrating true generality. It is also not clear as you tune for more and more cases, are you degrading prior cases (sort of like the game of whac-a-mole) or are you truly building up intelligence? Even if you are building up intelligence, it may just be more fitting by increasing complexity of machine learning models rather than true generalizing on very novel scenarios (outside of the training distribution). There must be some intrinsic physics type of model that is happening in the human cognition that makes a human never make silly mistakes or get totally baffled on novelty in driving, and we see no evidence of this yet in the machines. In that sense, we may be hitting a limit that is higher but fundamentally not too different than the old school AI if/then/else case enumerations to solve this problem.\n\nA human driver that has achieved a certain level of competence in driving can drive quite well in any new geography (e.g another country) or environment where s/he has never driven before and then can also learn quickly in the new environment to be as agile as in the known environments. Until the machines are able to demonstrate this level of performance, they will remain inferior even as they may show statistically better performance due to avoiding fatalities happening due to incompetent human drivers (drunk, distracted etc driving).', 'Great interview.

And then be willing to do all the less interesting tasks that have to be done to succeed at anything.  \r\n\nI was moved by the background of the interview.  Lex works in the AV field (I think) and is a professor at MIT, and Kyle is someone who dropped out of MIT to help create and sell two businesses for $1B, the second of which was in the AV world.

And the way we acomplish that is to rethink our weapons first! we need to talk to physicist and toxin specialists to test revolutionaire, maybe not that precise, but agile! (agility is really important as precision is not, since we are not dealing with potentially lethal weapons). So with that in mind... we shall aproach any situation with full force. the objective of any action is to incapacitate the enemy, the killing is a collateral.

My thoughts are below and I will, of course, participate in a discussion in comments if someone has further ideas:\n\n_Brief background_: there have been multiple proof-of-concept studies done on tricking an AI into making a false classification (e.g. ""Adversarial Patch"", by T. Brown, et. al, Dec 2017, you can find it on arxiv). Basically, they showed that having enough information on the structure of an image recognition algorithm, we can design stickers that will confuse the model. For example, you have a picture of bananas on a table and AI classifies them as ""bananas on a table"", but if you introduce a specific sticker to the image (even when it is small relative to bananas themselves), the model with almost absolute confidence will say that the image is of a toaster.\n\nThis possibility already causes problems in autonomous vehicles field, since people started designing stickers that when put on a road sign will cause a misclassification. Now, this issue can be addressed pretty successfully (imho) by keeping an updated openly distributed database of street sign locations, so a car can validate it\'s an assumption there, and by letting a car access a subset of relevant parameters from the last couple of cars that passed here to compare an assumption to what other algorithms had (IoT should help). \n\nHowever, issues with the military are much more complex as they imply highest degrees of confidentiality.\n\n_Case_: assume you have a ""counselling"" algorithm of large scale that\'s designed to analyse the big picture of a particular battlefield to help you navigate the resources and make strategic decisions. How far are we from a potential enemy reverse engineering your model using military intelligence data, data collected by analysing your behaviour and decision making in real life applications of the system etc., and designing a ""noise attack"" that will cause misclassifications on such scale?\n\nUltimately, the enemy would prefer a model that can make your drones target your own soldiers, but to me, it seems more likely that early applications of such attack systems that target enemies AI will be simpler and more of a ""noise""-causing attacks. For example, to make you think that there are significant enemy forces being accumulated in some area suggesting a strike, while the area is actually empty... Or maybe it happened so that there is a school there?\n\nNow let\'s go one step deeper. You know that your enemy might be capable of attacking your AIs this way. What\'s an obvious reaction? To me, that would be to develop more sophisticated algorithms that will validate that what seems to be a school bus is not actually a disguised tank. However, what are the chances of this model making a mistake and you shooting at a school bus? What are the chances that this validation model itself gets a ""noise attack""?\n\n_Discussion and my suggestions_: all this complexity will be further convoluted by lack of info, which makes it hard to differentiate whether a decision was an unfortunate mistake made by AI, whether it was an accident caused by enemy orchestrating a noise attack or it was an intentionally designed attack that has as its goal blaming you and your AI? In the world where information war becomes one of the main battlefield areas, the complexity of these issues and lack of information will give many opportunities to violate human rights codes for military or geopolitical advantages. Answering questions like ""was there an intend?"" and ""who is responsible?"" will be rather difficult and might take a lot of time, which is an issue in terms of the information war.\n\nI have one possible solution (partial solution, of course, but just to start this discussion) that is basically going back to autonomous vehicles problem - having an agreement that every country that uses AI in the military must make _some types_ of data *public*. I can already see how hard it will be to negotiate and how many ways there are to avoid sharing any meaningful data or just trying to fake it. However, I think by making some general low-sensitive data publicly available, every party that is involved basically shows its adherence to the human rights (like saying I\'m not doing anything illegal, go check) and that would allow any third party to open access and validate the lack of intent in case of an unfortunate tragic event.', 'It would have been nice if he had spent more time focused on the topic at hand (AGI involved in weapons systems and policies regarding that) and less on ""simple"" pattern recognition AIs used for target acquisition.

Therefor maybe smaler staates can be participants in a global 'camp' to bring the legal issues further in their own interest to not become overrun from larger states. Another danger that i think hasn't been adressed in the presentation are autonomus systems, which can be abused from small groups  to do harm to society - i think it should not be worked out just by the states themself, but by a global community.""]"

So I am not trying to push beliefs onto anybody but am open to learn. Here are my thoughts:\n\nMusk famously reasons from first principles and has fantastic success with it. Now as I read it, this idea means boiling it down to the bare essentials and reasoning upwards. \n\nIn my understanding reasoning upwards to a more generalized rule equals inductive reasoning as suggested e.g. by John Stuart Mill (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill%27s_Methods). \n\nWhen looking further into the first principles method though it seems to stem from Descartes and is supposedly a form of deduction - so not induction but its opposite. \n\nNow, I am really confused here since as far as I understand, reasoning upwards from a single instance to a new general rule and not be blinded by old false premises and assumptions is the generalization exactly the central aspect of inductive reasoning. \n\nSo Musks example of questioning / ""cartesian doubting"" the battery price for the Teslas means: Not being blinded by the ""common wisdom/rule"" of how expensive batteries are which would deduce logically something like this: \n\nA --> All batteries are expensive (If this premise is true)\nB --> You need batteries for your Tesla (And this premise is true)\nERGO C --> Your Teslas battery must be expensive, too. (Then the conclusion must be true as well)\n\nBut Musk doesn\'t follow this approach. Instead he looks at reality, sees cheap stock prices of the bare battery components and induces the more general rule that it must be possible to produce batteries much cheaper. \n\nA --> Batteries are made of several components\nB --> These bare battery components are today much cheaper than they use to be \nERGO C --> Today it is within reason to build batteries much cheaper and successfully create a car company on top of it\n\nIsn\'t that inductive reasoning?

They somehow seek towards a ideal form of triangle in heaven. Forms such as goodness, trustworthyness, kindness, and friendliness also search for perfect forms in heaven but these forms are not perceived with the senses like the material world but through understanding, reasoning and a general appreciation of seeking for a decent human self that love which Plato said is the one perfect form on heaven and earth encourages to reach for perfect forms of conduct, behaviour and enlightenment on Earth."", ""Fascinating.

Think about it: where does seretonin develop? How does one\'s emotions change after a good meal, or after a bad one? What about when they have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) or some such similar physical ailment where the waste in the body is literally leaking into the blood stream through holes in the gut/colon microbiome, and how does this affect emotions?\n*Nutritional Delivery Matters. When nutrients are more bio-available the body functions better, and the whole system improves. Why isn\'t this holistic ideal being included in the conversation?\nI mean, she did include ""metabolic costs"" as a variable in emotional function... but I feel she was incredibly lacking in depth. Maybe given the audience.\n\nI just think this superficial facial expression and visual analysis is so cheap and limited. It is appallingly, shockingly inaccurate.\n\n*Also: What about the emotional-vibrational scale?\nWe have tools such as heat maps and musical scales / acoustic listening / radar / sonar / etc. for visually mapping using heat and sound (*or other environmental chemical, even a stress hormone or sweat measured produces a distinct scent and chemical production in the environment, which can be measured objectively and interpreted using data analysis).\nWhy aren\'t we using these tools to measure emotional intelligence? And coordinate social harmony like you would a musical ensemble, or band.\n\n*Memories are held in cellular memory; i.e., the body keeps the score.\nWe have to look at: cellular garbage collection and removal, techniques for emotional therapy such as EFT (tapping) and musical therapy (*look at Dr. Emoto\'s water droplet experiments and the fact the human body is >70% water, can be easily manipulated. What crappy, shitty, hostile music is playing on repeat on the radios? It is acoustic bombardment, bringing down cellular function through crappy modern rap music filled with gun violence and hookers, breakups and alcohol lyrics, etc.).\n*Why aren\'t we simply measuring the ""color score"" of people\'s auras? This is easily captured with various photography or sonar/etc technologies.\n\n\nJust some food for thought. I hope to stimulate an interesting discussion.

Tools constantly evolve, but making something visually captivating always requires those same core skills. It still takes an artist to make art. That hasn't changed.\n\nWhat we figured out here is a very advanced form of old-fashioned rotoscoping. Animation takes a lot of forms; Traditional, 3d, stop-motion... They all have different strengths, and enable different stories. Our method here isn't a replacement, but an attempt at something new.\n\nWhat excites me is that this tech makes it easier to bring my visual ideas to life. Ideas that were otherwise impossible. When I said this democratizes animation, I'm referring to the near-insurmountable mountain of work needed to make a full-length narrative animation. Currently that requires large studios and large budgets. Doing it on your own is nearly impossible.\n\nBut I see potential in these tools to change that! That's what I'm so excited about. Imagine one person, or a few friends, bringing their crazy ideas to life. Imagine if a traditional animator could automatically have their drawings inked and colored. Imagine eliminating the uncanny valley on cgi faces. These tools have the potential to do that. We're trying to figure out how, and sharing our journey. If we want community-controlled AI tools, we need to develop them as a community, otherwise they become proprietary tools locked behind a company.\n\nAnd yes, this can be done with your own style. We trained our model, not from hundreds of artists, but from ONE film- Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust.  We've been very open about this, and I think it's important to be. But this is also an experiment and a loving parody of this era of anime. I consider it no less ethical than the countless other videos on our channel that borrow from pop culture to tell their story.\n\nSudden change can be scary, especially if it feels like your passion or livelihood is on the line. But that's why we're out here exploring it.

Why is that the core problem you ask? Cuz anime relies heavily on their characters and world building to carry the narrative through. while feature films do to its more restrictive and shorter time slots relies on the story plot and its philosophical conflict to carry its narrative through. since the story plot and philosophical conflicts of an anime is built around the characters and world itself something that a shorter 2 hrs or less feature film can't really focus on you can see the problem here. if an anime series or even a tv show is adapted into a feature film, everything that makes it great in the first place will have to be taken out to fit the restrictive time slot. imagine if a tv show like Westworld or breaking bad was to be adapted into a feature film and the entirety of the story which is built around the characters and world itself had to be fitted into 2 hours. that wouldn't be very good now would it. these facts and the fact that some anime story concept  only work in a cartoon but would make absolutely no sense in live action film is the reason why Hollywood adaptation sucks."", 'Thank you Corridor To exposed Hollywood Bullsh*t they Done over the years', 'Too much internal monologue is a problem in live action.

The tennis scene is a little different because they're doing something visual. If that was done in live action i think you could just have them speaking out loud under their breath.

1070,brffDCE5hXs,"[""Hey guys, thanks for watching!\r\n\r\nJust wanted to add my thoughts for those out there who maybe don't even know what it is they WANT to learn in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to picking a direction it can feel daunting, and the possibilities endless, but I believe a great first step is trying to figure out where you want to be in one year, five years, and ten years from now. What brings you joy? What do you see others doing and think, ‚ÄúI want to do THAT‚Äù.\r\n\r\nIn the 3D world, for example, there‚Äôs so many different paths you can take from modeling, texturing, lighting, compositing, or even just being a generalist who does a little bit of everything. Each of these paths lead to different end goals and the same is true in almost any field. So before starting down one specific path think about what makes you tick, and most importantly what makes you happy.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the video, my initial plan was to go to USC and become an editor at Warner Brothers. I had no other dreams of doing anything else, and getting rejected completely ruined my plans. But by leaning on the skills I‚Äôd learned in working towards that initial goal, I changed course and used those skills to spur me on to a new, adapted goal.\r\n\r\nThings will always change, but picking an initial direction and starting to build momentum and discipline are sure fire ways to make progress on ANY path. Movement of any kind is better than remaining static.\r\n\r\nAll to say, you don‚Äôt have to pick with 100% accuracy right out the gate. You can always use the things you‚Äôve learned to adapt your goal as/if your interests change, but in that process you are still building the skills and discipline along the way that make that change of course much faster and easier.\r\n\r\nBest of luck my friends!"", 'Thanks this is extremely helpful guys...you guys are Awesome üí™üíõ', 'i watched this after i gave up on life... my bad', 'Wonderful and encouraging \n\nI‚Äôm 42 and just now wanting to start a new art in 3D animation and visual effects.

The goal is to one day work with or maybe along side Corridor :P but I have a long way to go before I can seat with the greats. Thanks again for giving me inspiration, honestly if you guys hosted a VFX workshop or a class I'd sell everything I owned to pay for it so I can finally learn this. i have so many cool movie idea's and I just really want to express myself but I've never been able to sit down and take the time to make it happen."", 'im gonnadie alone with literally 0 chance of ever getting any job anywhere, or finding any friend, or anyone who loves me. etc. you should put some brackets in the title and say ""only applies to lucky people with rich parents and no mental illness"". goodbye', 'im gonnadie alone with literally 0 chance of ever getting any job anywhere, or finding any friend, or anyone who loves me. etc. you should put some brackets in the title and say ""only applies to lucky people with rich parents and no mental illness""', 'Beautiful video!üíØ', '10/10 video', ""Thanks so much for this video.

Normally you trace from camera to surface and then you trace in the direction of each light to see if the patch of surface is illuminated. But if light is to come through reflection or refraction it could be coming through any path. You'd have to render the entire scene from the PoV each surface patch just to calculate 2nd level lighting. Or you could trace photons forward from the light, have them deposit on surfaces randomly like textures, and then trace the scene from the camera and hope you got enough photons. That's the slow technique that I worked on way back.

He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God (2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 and Revelation 2:10). Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!\r\n\r\nif thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. -- Romans 10:9 KJV\r\n\r\nNow when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13 KJV\r\n\r\nSeek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\r\n\r\nBe ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.\r\n\r\nTo anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:\r\nGet a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. To anoint your home or other building: place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick: place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.

Does the interior edge of the Stargate \'prop\' have a mass of red laser markers (appearing similar to bar code scanners on-set) drawing red lines at a specific point that is then used as the reference markers that the VFX artists can then remove in post?\n(Red laser markers are the only thing I can think of, but the downside is the refraction at _the contact points_ would show and you\'d have to somehow paint _that_ out as well, so I don\'t have a solid guess.

I think the 2008 is the best the Hulk has ever looked. 2003 the technology just wasn't quite there yet and they did have strange lighting for shots. But it was impressive. 2012 doesn't look bad and is somewhat intimidating but I think he's much less intimidating than 2008. Then as time passes, it just gets worse. He gets smaller, starts resembling a middle aged man, then a senior citizen who used to take PEDs. \n\nThe lighting, grading and shaders I thought looked better on the 2008 Hulk. I'm sure if we were to put them in the same environment next to each other, you could tell the 2017-2022 Hulk is probably technically more detailed. But just because he's more detailed doesn't mean he's a better character model. I'm fairly certain the 2008 one also had pores, but they're much more toned down and that honestly makes it look like he's got monster skin, which I would think should be the point, not to just be an oversized man (that is not what the Hulk is). His rig system for muscles is pretty much on par with the the 2012 one in my opinion, except I liked 2008 one better because it seems like the used soft body physics or cloth dynamics to add that extra layer for his movement and when he'd get hit. I also think the 2008's look of really shredded muscles looks much more badass and terrifying than a 17-20% bodyfat Hulk. Also something about the way they animated him seemed more viscious and horrifying to me. \n\nAnd this isn't really about the character model, but the sound design is 100% superior in 2008. They made him sound genuinely fucking bone chilling and the roars would make you shit a little in real life (and in theaters when I first saw it lol). Mark Ruffalo's just sounds like a man who has gained a deeper pitch and that's about it. The audio mixing isn't as good either I don't think.

The risk to the officer and the individual begin to rise signifigantly when the individual begins to be confrontational and non-compliant. This is just common sense.

Since we all have sinned, and fallen short, how can we be saved from this eternal place?\n\nRomans 5:8 ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù\n\nThe good news, the gospel, is that God was born of a virgin, lived a perfect, sinless and holy life, as Jesus of Nazareth, and sacrificed Himself for our sins. He shed His blood and died on the cross and took upon Himself the wrath of the Father so that we might go free. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb, and then as prophesied, resurrected by the power of God and defeated sin, death and hell. Whosoever believes in Him and follows Him will have eternal life! Forgiven of all sin, saved from death and hell and given a new heart to truly know Him. That is the mercy and love that Christ showed on the cross. He was perfect, yet died for imperfect people like us.

If we are living sinful lives, breaking the ten commandments, and not acknowledging God in our hearts, God must punish us for our wickedness. God must send us to hell, a place of torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, where all unrepentant sinners will go. Since we all have sinned, and fallen short, how can we be saved from this eternal place?\n\nRomans 5:8 ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù\n\nThe good news, the gospel, is that God was born of a virgin, lived a perfect, sinless and holy life, as Jesus of Nazareth, and sacrificed Himself for our sins. He shed His blood and died on the cross and took upon Himself the wrath of the Father so that we might go free. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb, and then as prophesied, resurrected by the power of God and defeated sin, death and hell. Whosoever believes in Him and follows Him will have eternal life! Forgiven of all sin, saved from death and hell and given a new heart to truly know Him. That is the mercy and love that Christ showed on the cross. He was perfect, yet died for imperfect people like us.

If we are living sinful lives, breaking the ten commandments, and not acknowledging God in our hearts, God must punish us for our wickedness. God must send us to hell, a place of torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, where all unrepentant sinners will go. Since we all have sinned, and fallen short, how can we be saved from this eternal place?\n\nRomans 5:8 ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù\n\nThe good news, the gospel, is that God was born of a virgin, lived a perfect, sinless and holy life, as Jesus of Nazareth, and sacrificed Himself for our sins. He shed His blood and died on the cross and took upon Himself the wrath of the Father so that we might go free. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb, and then as prophesied, resurrected by the power of God and defeated sin, death and hell. Whosoever believes in Him and follows Him will have eternal life! Forgiven of all sin, saved from death and hell and given a new heart to truly know Him. That is the mercy and love that Christ showed on the cross. He was perfect, yet died for imperfect people like us. Please take the time, you are not promised tomorrow, to read these next verses humbly and honestly and pray for God to forgive you of your sin and grant you His Holy Spirit and forgiveness in Jesus Christ. God bless you in Jesus\' mighty name! Amen.\n\nRomans 10:9 ‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.‚Äù\n\nJohn 3:16 ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù\n\nJohn 14:6 ‚ÄúJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.‚Äù\n\nJohn 11:25-26 ""Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

If we are living sinful lives, breaking the ten commandments, and not acknowledging God in our hearts, God must punish us for our wickedness. God must send us to hell, a place of torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, where all unrepentant sinners will go. Since we all have sinned, and fallen short, how can we be saved from this eternal place?\n\nRomans 5:8 ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù\n\nThe good news, the gospel, is that God was born of a virgin, lived a perfect, sinless and holy life, as Jesus of Nazareth, and sacrificed Himself for our sins. He shed His blood and died on the cross and took upon Himself the wrath of the Father so that we might go free. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb, and then as prophesied, resurrected by the power of God and defeated sin, death and hell. Whosoever believes in Him and follows Him will have eternal life! Forgiven of all sin, saved from death and hell and given a new heart to truly know Him. That is the mercy and love that Christ showed on the cross. He was perfect, yet died for imperfect people like us. Please take the time, you are not promised tomorrow, to read these next verses humbly and honestly and pray for God to forgive you of your sin and grant you His Holy Spirit and forgiveness in Jesus Christ. God bless you in Jesus\' mighty name! Amen.\n\nRomans 10:9 ‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.‚Äù\n\nJohn 3:16 ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù\n\nJohn 14:6 ‚ÄúJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.‚Äù\n\nJohn 11:25-26 ""Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

1778,V3fPJyLYjiM,"['Hey Everyone! *Parts list for the drone is in the description!* _Explanation here_:\n\nThe drone I built is a modified Inductrix Blade, most commonly referred to as a ""Tiny Whoop"". You can buy fully built kits, DIY kits, or buy the individual parts and assemble it together like I did. You will also need a radio transmitter (the controller) and some FPV goggles to view the camera feed. You can also just use a little monitor screen that has a radio antenna attached. I already had these from when I started getting into racing drones last year. If you go the build-it-yourself route you will want to watch a lot of tutorials and will need a soldering iron. It wasn\'t as hard as I expected it to be though ;)\n\nI was flying in what\'s called ""*Acro*"" mode, meaning that it does *_not_* fly like a DJI drone. If you set it to ""level"" mode, it will behave that way, but in acro mode it will not self-correct so you can easily do things like flips and barrel rolls, but also makes it way more difficult to fly. If you press forward on the sticks, it will continue to go forward until it\'s upside down haha. I\'ve started learning how to do flips and stuff but I need to set better PIDs.\n\nThe main components of the drone are the airframe, props, motors, flight controller (brain), camera, and batteries. I provided links to everything I could in the description. You can choose more powerful motors which will give you more agility and ability to do flips. I went with the middle-power motors for now but will probably upgrade soon. ALSO, the radio antenna on my camera is a linear one rather than the cloverleaf configuration normally seen as default with the tiny whoops, because it\'s supposedly harder to break. The bigger antennas break easily. I also hot-glued some tooth-picks from the antenna to the frame for added support. \nGood luck everyone!', ""With tiny stuff like that you're supposed to use a special soldering tip they are like super fine-tips idk how you did it with that thing.  You can't be too bad at it if you accomplished that lol"", ""His grandfather's name was Shia.

If we are living sinful lives, breaking the ten commandments, and not acknowledging God in our hearts, God must punish us for our wickedness. God must send us to hell, a place of torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, where all unrepentant sinners will go. Since we all have sinned, and fallen short, how can we be saved from this eternal place?\n\nRomans 5:8 ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù\n\nThe good news, the gospel, is that God was born of a virgin, lived a perfect, sinless and holy life, as Jesus of Nazareth, and sacrificed Himself for our sins. He shed His blood and died on the cross and took upon Himself the wrath of the Father so that we might go free. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb, and then as prophesied, resurrected by the power of God and defeated sin, death and hell. Whosoever believes in Him and follows Him will have eternal life! Forgiven of all sin, saved from death and hell and given a new heart to truly know Him. That is the mercy and love that Christ showed on the cross. He was perfect, yet died for imperfect people like us.

Take the same parts of Ship A to build a ""new"" ship, then you\'re just rebuilding Ship A and giving it a new name, if ever. I don\'t get where the paradox is. It can\'t depend on the definition of ""ship"" either - the name, or the parts - because either way, my logic still stands. Ship B is a new ship with the old name, Ship A is the old ship with a new name. Someone halp me I have a hard time getting out of my own head sometimes.\n\nedit: i just saw +@UC1iSHgNI5PA4wnijvIf28OAcomment. so it\'s a slightly different premise in that the parts are replaced over time. hmm. So it comes down to the name or the concept of the thing. It can be all replacement parts after decades, but since you\'re only keeping the name (your name, after OP\'s example of molecule replacement), it\'s still all-new parts just with the same original name. If you take all the replaced parts and build a replica, it\'s still basically rebuilding the ship (yourself) under a new name. The two ships (persons) are still different, but under two separate parameters (physically and conceptually (or what others would say, metaphysically)). If we\'re going with the human as the example, then I\'d argue you\'re constantly changing, growing, and evolving, while keeping your understanding of self (manifests as your name or however you identify yourself, your ""soul""). Therefore you are both physically different over time, but conceptually the same person, unique because senses of selves are unique (you\'re a like a massive cocktail of molecule combinations/DNA, personality traits, beliefs, values, knowledge). A person made of your old molecules (ew) would be an entirely different person because their ""concept"" or ""self"" is different. The physical parts don\'t inherently carry your cocktail mix.\n\nUnless it\'s proposing two different assumptions of ""self"": the body and soul are one therefore your molecules contain parts of your soul; or they\'re different. I guess I worked under the second assumption. Although, it\'s possible I\'m just being subconsciously stubborn about my logic. So yeah I\'m still at a loss on where the paradox is. \n\nMan I miss logic exercises. The first assumption suggests that you\'re slowly being replaced and discarded therefore you\'re always a new person...which is a nice way of looking at things but that also means your replacement parts are foreign. They can be the new experiences and realizations you get everyday which is why your sense of self and worldview change over time.

The color grading, fake police cars and uniforms for a nearly 70 million dollar film (I live in the Netherlands, the fake police cars really bothered and distracted me) and the shaky camera fights really ruined the movie. Even though the movie itself wasn't super sucky. I often even wondered whether they were actually filming in the Netherlands or not. That's how distracting some of those details were. Made me wonder if they filmed some of it in Belgium or France instead."", ""i will say that as i was making movies, my friend said to me, no put that there and this here.. and i was like, but it doesn't fit the rythmn of your movie ! and he was like, i know what i want ! but everytimes i thoguht, but your film has a rythmn and you are just ignore it for the sake of shots ! and i think that's the problem with most movies now a days... they want fast action but fast action means we see less and less, and thats why they take that road, they want fast movement, but do not consider their audiences at all. i preffer slower movies that can accelrate or slow down while still seeing the action and the environment then just scenes with great shot that have no context.\n\nits all about rythmn really.  take this example... i wanna put an intro to a youtube channel documentary videos... i could pull off tons of footage and wrender them as a 1 minute long intro. but is that really an intro ? no, to me a great intro is not long... i'm talking about 10 to 15 seconds long. how much can i put into that ? so i have these videos showing for a second and then fading as another shot comes in. but heres the trick... 1 second is not long enough for context ! so now where i wanted 10 shots, i'm down to 5 because now i'm down to 2 seconds each shot. that's rythmn. \n\nquestion you should really be asking yourselves is... if i know nothing of the movie or the scene... audience who never saw the footage... would i know what's hapenning ? if the answer is no, then you are off rythmn ! imagine a boxing match where both people are trying to be on their own rythmn. the winner is the one who sucessfully get the other into his rythmn... same happens here... you are trying to bring the audience into your rythmn. so yeah, don't throw your rythmn off just because of a cool shot you absolutely want in your film !"", ""Clearly they haven't seen Indian movies, most of them are mixture of bullshit."", 'Great video!', 'Are you implying that 30 years ago actions scenes never sucked.

Although I\'m not sure if there\'s any tips I can give you that they haven\'t already... like ""finish what you start"", I CAN say, however, that you definitely grow out of that stage. And I think it comes when you DO finally finish something, and realize how awesome it feels, and you begin to see how much time you\'ve wasted not finishing things (or not even starting things in many cases). Also think about the fact that you have plenty of time to accomplish many projects throughout your life. Don\'t get wrapped up in thinking your first project has to be your Academy Award-nominated piece. Really understand that making projects is the way you grow. Just like anything else in life: practice, practice, practice. Thinking that your first projects are going to be perfect (no matter how much you think they can be), is what will kill you in the end. It will keep you from ever finishing because things will not be living up to the expectation in your mind of how the project should be going. Just HAVE FUN! That\'s the ultimate tip. Pretend like you\'re a kid again making home movies (if you did that sort of thing). There are people in Hollywood making millions off of movies and they\'re still not happy (for one, because money doesn\'t satisfy if that was their goal), but for two because they\'ve lost the enjoyment that their former selves got from making movies. I think a main reason is perfectionism and crowd pleasing. You become so focused on the outcome of your movie instead of the enjoyable process. Which leads to what I\'ve already said: Extremely high expectations that can\'t be met. And as much fun as they are when they rarely come around, movies don\'t NEED to be perfect. Critics have kind of ruined movies in a way. We\'ve turned what was supposed to be an artistic form of escapism into a list of standards that have to be met. Even people watching movies these days can\'t fully enjoy them because we\'re analyzing them the whole time. Have fun, be a kid, make some magic.', 'nice!', 'Just do it!!  üòÇ']"

Basically, I could easily see it as being a mixture of the Niko trying to get it as close to them as he could; The landing preset kicking in, and radio interference confusing the drone. It could be as simple as the battery kicking in the preset with a mixture of the crosswind or a radio frequency that wasn't active prior to the crash getting a heavy load of traffic.\n\nAdmittedly, I doubt my own theory about a burst of radio interference, however I did want to throw out some credence to Sam's speculation. If there was a repeater on that tower that suddenly kicked to life with heavy traffic the sheer power put out by the transmission could potentially screw with any signal coming from the control to the Drone.

2153,dY6jR52fFWo,"[""Hello, sorry for the rather short episode today! Spent a lot of time experimenting with this, but didn't end up with much to show for it unfortunately.\nI think coding as a gameplay mechanic is a really interesting concept, but I struggled to make something fun out of it. Would love some recommendations for games to play, if you know any games which do it well?\n\nFinally, in case anyone here is wondering about the source-code to the last coding adventure (since I've been promising to upload it for a while) -- I'm probably going to start working on a part 2 of the ecosystem sim in the next few weeks, and I'll try tidy up the project and release it then."", 'Just found your channel today, and you\'ve made me want to download unity again. I tried once long ago (I have always dreamed of making a video game ever since I was a little kid with an N64), and I\'ve always been able to come up with neat ideas for different mechanics (especially for RPGs and the like), but the actual nuts and bolts of it all was just a little bit much to take in at once. Since then, I have gained more experience with small projects (making minecraft mods, following a roguelike tutorial using Python, messing around in Blender, that type of thing), but you\'ve really inspired me today. This is a type of game I have always wanted to play but could never find one that was decent enough. I envision something that someone who doesn\'t code at all could sit down and actually have fun playing instead of spending three hours following an online (or in-game) tutorial just to be able to get past the first puzzle. I picture something that can present a problem that is complex enough to make a professional programmer scratch their head a bit, but that your average layman could also solve given enough time and clues.\n\nYou could have a setting where you work for some manufacturer of automated machinery set in the not-so-distant future. Your goal is to debug the faulty machines that have been returned to the company. You\'d have a little test bed set up specific to whatever machine it is you\'re working on, and a console displaying the current program that is loaded onto the machine, which can be edited, compiled, and re-uploaded to the machine. Your job would be to try and fiddle with the code, then test the machine to make sure it runs properly, then send it back as a refurbished product. You could make it interesting and allow the player to send out something that is still incorrect, causing it to be returned again, opening the door to a sort of meta game where your work influences the success of the company and what contracts they can obtain, and maybe you can even get fired, and that would be how you lose. \n\nYou could even have the ""correct"" program available to the player, in the form of reference documents, which could also be edited by the player (adding notes, or creating entirely new documentation for some piece of coding the player came up with). The first several ""levels"" would be small syntax errors in the code (missing parentheses/brackets/semicolons, mis-capitalized letters, etc), so that way you could slowly ease the player into formatting and what looks right and what doesn\'t. As you progress through the game, you get more and more complex errors (missing lines of code, arithmetic errors and so on), and less and less help from your reference documents (maybe the paper only describes the root nature of a function, but the problem requires you to string several functions together in a creative way, or maybe your reference displays the code in C# but you\'re trying to work with Python, or something like that). You could eventually open it up to allowing the player to create new custom machines that operate off of scripts written entirely by the player.\n\nIt\'d lean heavily towards one of those ""simulator"" games (the setting I have put forth reminds me a bit of car mechanic simulator but with software), but hey, plenty of people enjoy those (myself included).\n\nAnother idea: Programming robots for robot fights in your back yard. That would be more action-y and if accompanied with a 3-D editor allowing the player to create custom robots with articulating parts, could have a lot of potential if done right. Coding the bot to properly respond to its array of sensors and inputs from a controller would be a challenging problem for the player, but also very rewarding when you crush the opponent\'s robot. Would actually be really fun if it was a multiplayer game. Of course, you\'d have to create the fighting portion of the game, simulate the robots as well as the damage they receive (which could be as simple as having a health bar or simple value (x/100) for each part), including sensor blackouts (getting a camera knocked out would likely impede the bot\'s pathfinding), but the more I think about it, the more I want to throw my wallet at whoever decides to make it.\n\nI won\'t pretend to know how complex making a game like that would be, and I could never hope to create even a small portion of what I described here, but I still wish it existed.', 'This is soooooooooo friggin awesome dude!!!', 'The problem with coding games is that most people will interpret it as a ""learning to code"" game which kills the fun in the long run.', 'This is the smartest idea I have seen from a game!', 'NAW WE PLAYED SPIRIT ROVER IN MY GAME DESIGN CLASS IN SEPTEMBER', 'Making a coding game?', 'Even if you make it too dificult there are people out there that will still enjoy it', 'Cooool...', 'I beg you to publish this game on Itch and continue working on it.']"

Now regarding the first part of this video, I end up having a nice character move just by using the Rotate function associated with horizontal input. Any advantages of using Sebastian method instead?', 'So I accepted the controller challenge, tried implementing my own version of player controller, then put on par with your implementation and adjust mine a lil\' bit, I figured out 1 thing: Your controller version has a buggy movement compared to mine.\nWhen your character moves in a direction then turns abruptly, like pressing A (left) then press D or W S, your character will move FORWARD a bit, relative to itself. I think this happens due to the smoothInputMagnitude, it makes the character turn smoothly but don\'t turn within its position. Why does this matter? Remember when you have to normalize input so that your character won\'t move faster when going diagonally? This problem is pretty similar to it, you can press 2 keys continuously as long as they\'re different (like A-D, W-S, A-S) to make your character move faster than moving normally by holding key(s). It\'s a room for exploit.\nHere\'s my implementation version, my version makes my character turn in its place so no buggy movement, just wiggling. I did applied Seb\'s LerpAngle into mine, it makes my character turn smoothly (than before). So I think the best answer here is to remove the Mathf.SmoothDamp() function, that will remove the buggy movement, to my knowledge, I\'m still a beginner though. \nEDIT: I found the reason, it\'s actually due to velocity = transform.forward * moveSpeed * smoothInputMagnitude. When I changed transform.forward into inputDirection, the buggy movement is gone. But it turns out my character has the buggy movement when it moves faster diagonally compared to Seb\'s when I used the technique aforementioned, lol. Then I tried applying the Mathf.SmoothDamp() function, so now 2 characters move identical, smoothly and no buggy movement. Damn.\nBy the way, thank you Seb, I\'ve been following your tutorials and I must say they\'re fantastic, the explanation is clear, the knowledge is vast, I\'ve learned a lot.

However, because we have that constant 90 degrees subtracting from Atan2 * Rad2Deg, the input angle becomes 90 degrees. This means that when we are not pressing anything, our character will face sideways, rotated about the y-axis by 90 degrees.\n\nThis doesn\'t happen when we swap the z and x in the Atan2 function because the constant 90 degrees is not there anymore. In this case, when Atan2 goes to zero (whenever we give no input), the entire inputAngle variable becomes zero, as it should, meaning our character will face forward (+Z) with no input instead of sideways (+X) as it did in the ""90 - "" method.\n\nI think this explanation is right?

The compiler would reject the code and tell you this.\n\nIt should be Point *p = new Point(5, 10); The * there makes it clear in the code that you're working with a pointer. The programmer EXPLICITLY invokes something like a reference instead of the language sneakily invoking a reference on the programmer behind their back.\n\nYes, pointers can be confusing, but they're probably the source of a LOT less hard-to-find bugs than implicit references. \n\nAnd yes, C++ does actually have a non-pointer reference semantic, but AGAIN, it requires that the programmer explicitly invokes them, and when the actual reference itself is used, the effects fall back to acting like you're acting by value. You pass things by reference into a function in C++, but you're not stuck dereferencing anything to work with it, and when you actually assign from something passed by reference, you're still invoking the expected copy semantics. \n\nIt does have the side effect of introducing side-effects, though, since passing by reference means you're not working with a copy of an object when you pass it into a function, so if you change the object passed by reference in a function it'll be changed in the caller function as well, which is why in C++ you'll most frequently see references being passed into functions as const, so that the object cannot be changed by the called function. \n\nBut, as much as I like Python and work with it, I'm not a fan of languages that assume it's safe to go into reference semantics without the programmer making that clear on their own. It's weird to me classes and structs are supposed to be the distinguishing factor in C#."", '7 minutes passed so quick']"

Not much, it's usually only a few pixels; and the player will float back up to the top of the platform.  Unfortunately this is a very problematic issue.  For thin platforms the player can occasionally fall right through them. And it is also, obviously, visually unpleasing to see the player sink into the platform upon landing occasionally.\n\n\nIs this something anyone else has experienced, or is this perhaps something unique to my interpretation of the code.

Then during mesh generator you dont make the border be of size one, but of size equal to current factor (still one thickness, just sampling from the offset equal to currently used factor).

Lesser seeds would expand to small sizes and come in clusters while greater seeds would expand to much bigger sizes(often times fusing together) and be far apart. Lesser seeds would generate islands and greater seeds would generate continents. The hills map would also be generated with lesser seeds(the spawning location and frequency of would be determined by biomes). The mountain chain map would be built from several starting points. from these 1-3 vectors would spring forth going away from each other. Each step there would be a new greater vector, the direction of which will be allowed to randomly deviate in some range of degrees. This range would be determined by the squiggliness variable and the side preference variable(if the vector prefers going left or right). The side preference would be randomly chosen each step. At the end of each greater vector(length of those vectors is determined by the length and girth variable + chance) the would be a high chance of 1-2 lesser vectors(length determined by girth variable and chance) spawning opposite each other. These lesser vectors would create valleys in between them. Also at each Greater vector end there would be a ""radiating"" height increase. Lastly the Highlands map would be generated by tightly packed and really girthy, short and squiggly mountain chains. There would also be a high chance that generated lesser vectors would be converted into greater vectors.', 'Is there a way to do this on an actual terrain object and not a plane object so we can use the tree painting tool?', 'for anyone who is wondering why their world is just a black texture disabling the plane should fix this. this happens because if 2 objects are in the same position and the 2 objects have the same look unity just defaults to a black material.', ""If you don't see the mesh.

It's probably not a good idea to move the passenger downwards when the player is below. What this does is it causes the player to hang at the bottom of the platform if they've jumped into it which is totally unnatural for a platformer. Since the player is never really otherwise pushed down (the platform moves down through the player if the player is grounded), the use of downward raycasts is redundant. It's best to only check vertical movement when the platform is moving up and let the last check of passenger riding on top to take care of downwards movement. One other significant and complicated problem, if you decide you want one way moving platforms, the detection for moving the player horizontal or down when they are stood on top of the platform does not detect when the player is actually on top of the platform which means you'll get get strange behavior of the player being sucked into the platform and pushed up if you try to jump through the platform. Implementing any check to make sure the player AABB is above the platform AABB unfortunately can interfere with the platforms ability to still hit the player with the raycast and move the player down when the player is riding on top and the platform is moving downwards, so you get a constant issue of the player bouncing and not staying attached to the platform.

Specifically, I am trying to drag and drop UIButton objects which have a rect(transform), image(sprite) and button(script) but do not have a mesh.

I'm investigating the EventSystems functions (OnDrag, etc) which are more cumbersome but seem to work for my current use. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on whether or not your method makes sense for manipulating (drag/drop) the new UI events or should it be restricted to mesh only objects?

This tutorial is a little below my level I guess, but only a little, and it was still interesting to watch.\n\nOne thing that bugged me was around 30:00 when you are describing how to make it select which image to use to represent the current heart's health. You have five images and you divide the health per heart by that length, so that each image represents an increment of 2 health. But actually, the very first image is an empty heart, and should represent 0 health, not 2! So I think there are only four actual 'steps', and each step should represent 2.5 health (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, to get the five images). So you want to divide by the length minus one, i.e.:\n\nint healthPerImage = healthPerHeart / (images.Length - 1);\nint imageIndex = currentHeartHealth / healthPerImage;\n\nI'm not sure how that works with rounding in this language; you might need to adjust for that slightly. But I think this would be better/more intuitive overall. As you see, in your example you end up with index 4, which is the full heart, because you get 8/2 = 4. But 8 is closer to the three-quarters heart, which realistically should represent 7.5. Plus, if you had 10 health, you'd get an index of 5, which doesn't even exist!

Il faut changer la d√©finition d\'un vaccin alors :). Normalement on a pas besoin de rappels pour un vaccin ( sauf pour quelque uns, et c\'est au bout de 10 ou 20 ans pas au bout de 4 mois), vous allez me dire on fait des rappels chaque ann√©e pour la grippe, oui, mais de 1 c\'est un vaccin qui n\'est pas obligatoire, 2 la majorit√© (je dis bien la majorit√© pas tous le monde) qui font se vaccins sont √¢g√©es ou ont des probl√®mes particuliers..\nUn autre point, et pour moi c\'est le plus important, comment est ce possible d√©j√† de recommander voire d\'obliger une vaccination ""pour tout le monde"" avec des vaccins qui ne sont pas encore valid√©s (ils sont tous en phase 3), et pour une infection qui ne tue qu\'une petite minorit√© <1% et ou la quasi totalit√© de ces moins de 1% sont des personnes √¢g√©es ou ont des maladies graves (l\'√¢ge moyen des d√©c√®s du covid co√Øncide toujours avec l\'√¢ge moyens des d√©c√®s dans chaque pays). Autre chose concernant les essais cliniques, d\'apr√®s mes connaissances, m√™me apr√®s la phase 3 il faut attendre une dizaines d\'ann√©es au minimum (phase 4) pour v√©rifier l‚Äôinnocuit√© √† long terme du vaccin en question...

What\'s presented is, in essence, the DP-3T algorithm, but needless to say it\'s a much-simplified version, so most security-related questions can be answered by going to https://github.com/DP-3T and reading the full details.  For example, if you\'re thinking that when Bob\'s phone recognizes some signals in the hospital\'s database, it can deduce _when_ Bob met with the someone now known to be sick by looking at where that message shows up on its ""What I heard"" list, you may be interested to learn how the full details of how these ids are generated and uploaded don\'t quite make that as possible as it would be for the simplified version outlined in Nicky\'s post.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is over the efficacy of Bluetooth systems like this.  For example, false positives due to signals shared through apartment walls, and false negatives due to touching a shared surface without ever being near someone.  No one claims that these will catch all contacts, but the goal is to have a system more scalable than in-person interviews, and what you need is for R to stay consistently below 1, not to catch all cases.  Any serious plans for reopening including a system like this also would include other practices driving this reproductive number down, like mask-wearing and distancing where possible.  Also, to the accuracy concerns, it seems worth mentioning that at least one person I know is working on https://www.novid.org/ which incorporates ultrasound to get a better sense of proximity.\n\nMany government-issued contact-tracing apps *do* use GPS in some way, so you\'d want to stay informed about whatever specific system is being advertised to you.  The purpose of Nicky\'s post is to make clear that contact tracing does not _imply_ location tracking.  If people (or governments) really want to use GPS based contact tracing too, there\'s no reason you can\'t have both.  But if you\'re in a country where people can choose to opt-in, you won\'t be including people who are concerned about privacy. \n\nAs to the status of the Google/Apple system, the first phase of their plan involved putting out an API that developers can use to build apps according to these standards, which is now done.

It sweeps out a region and will return to the original pivot once it has completed a half rotation in the plane of interaction.  Since any three points are mutually offset, there is only ever one point in the exact same interaction plane as the interacting point along the lines of the pivot exchange.\n\n\nThere are only two configurations therefore that are stable that preclude other interactions.\n\n1.  An oscillation on the outer boundaries between two or less points.\n2.  A cyclic oscillation around a point OR points in the domain: ie a lattice\n\n2 is trivial to disprove because there aren't any configurations possible due to mutual offsetting.  Since the only configuration in which points can be avoided infinitely are those which induce cyclic motion that preclude it, means you only need to prove 1 - that there exists no configurations between which the pivot doesn't switch.\n\n\nSince the sweep is predictable, that sweep takes in the entire search space.  The pivot also does not change the plane of the line - it continues as it would normally.  If it were chaotic it would not be possible to prove because there would exist an insignificant probabilistic chance of a mutually sweeping pivot between a small group of objects.  Thus provided that there is a point between that point and the last, there will always be another in network point to look at and the only case in which this is not true involves sweeping area outside of S, which is irrelevent.\n\nSo, for two bodies - it is impossible for the interaction space before to have contained another point since the interaction wouldn't have occured.  If another body exists, it therefore HAS to exist in the post interaction space and since that frame will sweep exactly one full half turn until it returns, all intractable points will be contained in that region.\n\nTherefore, if another body exists, it will always be interacted with and the only configuration in which that does not happen involves conditions rendered impossible by the lack of triplet co-linearity.  If three bodies can't be in a configuration to avoid mutual oscillation, adding additional bodies requires that it is possible to exclude all other bodies from the post swap event space.  Since this is not possible - the only rotations precluded are those which have already been covered clockwise down the interaction plane and would have resulted in an interaction anyway - all bodies are inevitably swept up, eventually."", 'On the ""social"" point, I\'ve noticed this phenomenon in all sorts of things I\'ve taught to people: programming, dance, woodworking, video games, etc. For human beings, it seems like an essential part of learning something is forgetting what it was like not to know that thing.', 'So I pasted this question into ChatGPT version 4 (the newest one since March 1), and this is what is says:\n1. Let S be a finite set of at least two points in the plane, and let n be the number of points in S. Since no three points are collinear, any line through two points of S will determine a unique angle with the horizontal axis.\r\n\r\n2. Consider all pairs of points (A, B) in S, and for each pair, calculate the angle that the line AB makes with the horizontal axis. Let\'s call this angle Œ∏(AB). Since there are n points, there are n(n-1)/2 pairs of points, and thus n(n-1)/2 angles. Divide the range of angles from 0 to 180 degrees into n-1 equally-sized intervals.\r\n\r\n3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one interval that contains at least n angles Œ∏(AB). Pick one such interval and let\'s call it I.\r\n\r\n4. Now, let\'s choose a line l, such that it forms an angle Œ± with the horizontal axis, where Œ± is the midpoint of interval I. Choose an arbitrary point P in S as the starting pivot.\r\n\r\n5. When the windmill process starts, since the line l initially makes an angle within the interval I, the next point Q it encounters will also form an angle within I, as the line rotates clockwise about P. When the line pivots about Q, the same argument applies, and the line will continue to rotate and pivot about points in S that form angles within I.\r\n\r\n6. Observe that the windmill process will eventually use each point in S as a pivot at least once. Since there are at least n angles within I and n points in S, we know that there will always be a point in S that the line can pivot to after rotating clockwise.\r\n\r\n7. The windmill process will continue indefinitely, and each point in S will be used as a pivot infinitely many times. This is because the line will keep rotating and meeting points with angles within the interval I, and since there are at least n angles in I, the line will never ""run out"" of points to pivot to.\n\nFascinating how ChatGPT can answer this question, but do you all see what step is inaccurate?', 'Looks like we got 4.3 million aspiring mathematicians', 'after watching your videos for a year, i‚Äôm baffled at how you consistently explain not only the solution to a math problem, but the process of thinking for an entire topic within math.

2507,brU5yLm9DZM,"['Some added notes (I may come back to add more later):\n\n1) There\'s a slight error in the video where I say the answer is floor(pi/theta).  Really it should be ceil(pi/theta) - 1, to account for the cases where pi/theta is an integer.  For example, when the mass ratio is 1, theta will be pi/4, so pi/theta is 4, but there are 3 clacks.  As stated in the video, though, you still think about this is ""how many times can you add theta to itself before it surpasses (or equals) pi?""\n\n\n2) What I animate here as I say ""angle of reflection"" and ""angle of incidence"" differs a little with convention.  Typically in optics, you look at the angle between the beam and a line *perpendicular* to the mirror, rather than with the mirror itself.\n\n3) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It\'s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you\'re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9\'s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9\'s has length 8, whereas you\'d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a ""normal"" number, roughly meaning that it\'s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin\'s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.\n\n4) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.

For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we did here.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this little sequence.

It\'s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you\'re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9\'s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9\'s has length 8, whereas you\'d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a ""normal"" number, roughly meaning that it\'s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin\'s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.\n\n2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.

For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we do next video.', 'This is sickeningly beautiful.

Then the upper bound of the inertial subrange is about 1/6 L, and the lower bound is about 60 L (œÅUL/¬µ)^(-3/4), where œÅ is the density of the fluid, U is the mean velocity over the plate, and ¬µ is the flow viscosity.

For many applications, with no pressure gradients (like in external flow, like the one shown in the footage) and with speeds well below the speed of sound (definitely like shown in the footage), compressibility effects are quite negligible.

The Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r\n\r\n I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula.

Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ‚àû which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.\r\n\r\n‚ÄªIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, ‚àû which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series Œ£ = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4œÄ^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong and is trickery.\r\n\r\n All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and is boundless. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom.\r\n\r\n Message from the spiritual world of Einstein \r\n When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority.

It is the creature which the vindictive spirits such as animals killed by eating meat dwell in cancer in cellulosity, and is going to possess and kill a human being. Therefore it recurs again no matter how much I cut it. Because the macrobiotec therapy exterminates dirty blood (the meat which I ate becomes the blood) becoming the cell of cancer by not taking in animal protein, and the book of cancer disappears, cancer becomes extinct. A lymphocyte of the immune system preys on a cancer and is cured by natural healing power. A cancer-causing agent is poison, and poison reduces natural healing power. It is necessary to raise weather of splenic (when I say in Western medicine stomach) to overcome a cancer. In other words, it is to bring back natural healing power. It is necessary to fix the balance of the Yin and Yang of the heart. Physical spirit are restored, and any disease can become the mind and body which can support.\r\n\r\n The Oriental medicine is Japanese old medicine, and the Shinto art book of Prince Shotoku, predecessors in the family line past event biography of an emperor completion is the thing which is based to pass. The basic principle of five six spirits of the natural world is written as constitution of the space. I understand the art and need Huang Ti wisdom to pass, and to be familiar with a bare question. I accept Western lie science, and the fool who is handled as a superstition in Shinto cannot understand Sino-Japanese traditional medicine. The disease is actually caused by the spiritual power of the demon. The Oriental medicine gets over by sending this malarial air outside a body by natural healing power.\r\n\r\n The Oriental medicine has a big difference with the coping therapy of the Western medicine in medicine to cure basis, a disease from a cause in Shinto fundamentally. Because it is medicine in conformity with false study to be called science, it is natural not to be cured and it returns when I consult a doctor and gets sick and is killed. The Western medicine is unorthodox, and Oriental medicine is the right track.\r\n\r\n You must take care of health by a meal to raise natural healing power. The meal strikes it for a small appetite on two meals of days. I stop the snack. The ingredients take only the thing made with natural agriculture. I avoid the thing which is soaked in manure, a pesticide. I take the seasonal thing. I eat brown rice. I do not eat the genetically-modified food (potato corn, soybean, grape Liquid sugar ). When I chew it well and digest it with saliva, a burden does not depend on the stomach and intestines.\r\n \r\n Near future to read from revelation of SUN and moon GOD ,and illuminaty card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan\r\n April, 2024 xx day    The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

The average will naturally split the probability space, since if it's smaller (let's say at 30deg then the 30 deg pie is of course smaller than a 160 deg pie, so we can say the line with the average should also be perpendicular to the first line (for a circle, assuming as here constant prob). Casually this becomes X and Y, and the probability of the 3rd point is the opposite quadrant as shown in the video.\nLet's continue similarly for the 3D. Let's try to find the average placement of 3 lines in 3D. Again as before, we fix the first one let's say in the X axis (in 3D now though). To obtain the next one, we need a perpendicular one, of which there are infinite (around the plane YZ), so let's just pick the Y axis, since all the lines in this plane should have the same chance. Then for the 3rd point, there's a line that can be picked at random that is the furthest (perpendicular) from the other 2, which is the Z axis. Now assuming the 3 points in the 3 main axis: X=1,Y=0,Z=0; X=0,Y=1,Z=0; X=0,Y=0,Z=1, we can see how only in the opposite quadrant would the tetrahedron make the point be in the middle.

That is, any vector in V can be expressed as a linear combination of u and v.\n\nNow, let\'s say that u = (1, 0) and v = (0, 1) are the two vectors in V. We can verify that any vector in V can indeed be expressed as a linear combination of u and v. For example, the vector (2, 3) can be written as:\n\n(2, 3) = 2(1, 0) + 3(0, 1)\n\nThis means that (1, 0) and (0, 1) span the entire vector space V.\n\nHowever, we still need to show that these two vectors are linearly independent. This means that neither vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the other. In other words, there is no non-zero scalar values a and b such that:\n\na(1, 0) + b(0, 1) = (0, 0)\n\nWe can easily see that this is true, since the only solution to this equation is a = b = 0. Therefore, (1, 0) and (0, 1) are linearly independent.\n\nSince (1, 0) and (0, 1) are both linearly independent and span the entire space V, they form a basis for V.\n\nIn summary, the basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space. The concept of a basis is important because any vector in the space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors, and this representation can be used to solve many problems in linear algebra.', ""There is another very good way of thinking about an independent vector. It's as follows :-\nIf a vector has some non - zero component in a direction which is perpendicular to the direction of all other vectors, it is linearly independent from the system of those vectors as it can't be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in any way."", 'so good', 'The idea of the moving plane, or line in 2 dimensional space, makes for a wonderful mental image when explaining why the entire set of the space becomes reachable even when vectors deviate only minutely in general direction.', 'cant thank you enough.', 'what', 'SIR, AMAZING LINEAR ALGEBRA BASICS VIDEOS.']"

I was a mathematics teacher in the early part of my career. I am challenged by visual cognition (for example I hate flowcharts, they dont help me think, they hinder). Mathematics is deeper than visual depictions. I think much better withoit them.  In the cases you give here its about relationships and objects (condidering numbers as objects not operations in this case though considering them as operations is also useful). Relationships are always deeper than one view. For this case, who memorises three rules ? To do that is to fail to grasp the relationship - a rule is just one expression of the relationship, its the relationship that carries the meaning - you build the rules when you need them - if you learn the rule you miss out 2/3 of the meaning. Of course ways of thinking are heavily influenced by notations and geometry can provide perspectives we might not reach in other ways but its not the essence, its a manifestation. The essence, as you realise, in this case is one manifestation of a symmetry and we need to think above that. Do students get there via concrete representations (learning rules)? Probably most do but not all and those that do are not doing mathematics. Mathematics is appreciating the relationships and their manifestations and working with them. One rule is not the essence, its a way to approach the essence via its relation to the other rules. Geometry is not the essence either.
